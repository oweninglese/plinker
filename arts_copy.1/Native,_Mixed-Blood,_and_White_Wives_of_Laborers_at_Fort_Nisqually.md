  Choosing between Corsets and Freedom
 [[Native]], Mixed-Blood, and White Wives of Laborers at [[Fort]] Nisqually, 1833-1860
 EMMA MILLIKEN
 six weeks after arriving at
 [[Fort]] Nisqually, Emma Thorn-
 hill, the wife of a farm laborer,
 ran off with two sailors from the ship
 that carried her from England to North
 America. On June 30, 1851, the chief
 clerk at the fort noted, "Thornhill and
 Cross off to Newmarket in chase of
 T[hornhill] 's wife who disappeared this
 morning, and is supposed to have made
 towards N[ewmarket] with a sister run-
 away and two sailors from Victoria."
 Richard Thornhill retrieved his wife the
 next day.1 Hers was hardly the behavior
 expected of a representative of the
 [[Hudson's\ Bay]] Company (HBC), much
 less of a woman from Victorian Eng-
 land. Yet all three of the white wives who
 arrived at [[Fort]] Nisqually between 1833,
 the year the [[Hudson's\ Bay]] Company
 built the fort between present-day
 Tacoma and Olympia, and 1860 seem
 to have lost their inhibitions upon ar-
 riving in the Pacific Northwest. Mean-
 while, their [[Native]] and mixed-blood
 counterparts, after marrying [[Fort]] Nis-
 qually laborers, appear to have taken on
 the behaviors expected of white Victo-
 rian women.
 The importance that [[Native]] and mixed-
 blood laborers' wives placed on Victo-
 rian ideas of behavior, and their willing-
 ness to conform, could have been a
 reflection of their changing role within
 the [[Hudson's\ Bay]] Company and within
 the Pacific Northwest. When European
 HBC men first began arriving in great
 numbers in the Pacific Northwest, they
 did as many of their predecessors had as
 they slowly migrated across [[Canada]] -
 they contracted marriages with women
 of the local populations. In 1683, com-
 pany officials in London had prohibited
 liaisons between employees and local
 women.2 However, London was almost
 a year's journey away, and the directive
 was ignored. The governors at London
 headquarters learned of the advantages
 of local liaisons in 1821 from George
 Simpson, who was at the time in charge
 of most of the northwest [[trade]]. "Connu-
 bial alliances are the best security we
 can have of the goodwill of the natives. I
 have therefore recommended the
 Gentlemen form connections with the
 principal Families immediately on
 their arrival." Simpson added, "The re-
 strictions which the Honble [sic] Com-
 mittee have put on Matrimonial alli-
 ances and which I consider most
 baneful to the interests of the Company
 are tantamount to a prohibition of
 forming a most important chain of
 connections with the [[Native]]s."3
 This was doubtless true, but the chief
 factor at [[Fort]] Vancouver, James Doug-
 las, was probably being more honest
 when he wrote in March 1842,
 There is indeed no living with comfort in
 this country until a person has forgot the
 great world and has his tastes and character
 formed on the current standard. . . . The
 vapid monotony of an inland trading Post,
 would be perfectly unsufferable, while habit
 makes it familiar to us, softened as it is by
 the many tender ties, which find a way to the
 heart.4
 In fact, George Simpson himself cer-
 tainly did not use his connubial alli-
 ances only to secure goodwill. Accord-
 ing to some perhaps apocryphal
 accounts, Simpson "fathered seventy
 sons between the Red River and the
 Rocky Mountains." He apparently sired
 so many children before his church-
 sanctioned marriage to his 18-year-old
 cousin Frances in 1829 that he ran out
 of names - and ended up with two
 Marias, two Georges, and two Jameses.5
 Initially the advantages of having a Na-
 tive wife were obvious. A [[Native]] Ameri-
 can woman was used to working - she
 cooked, mended, tanned leather, made
 moccasins and snowshoes, covered the
 canoes, made pemmican, and gathered
 firewood and [[food]]. In addition, [[trade]]
 with indigenous groups was easier if the
 wife spoke a variety of languages or if
 she was the daughter of a chief or other
 high-ranking person, which ensured
 commerce with her tribe. Furthermore,
 by decorating his wife with European
 textiles and jewelry and making her do-
 mestic life easier with metal utensils,
 the [[trade]]r accelerated the demand for
 goods among her people.
 contracted by the men of
 the upper echelons of fur-[[trade]]
 society or by the laborers, marriages of-
 ten started out as marriages à la façon du
 pays (in the fashion of the country).
 This was basically an [[agreement]] of mar-
 riage without the blessing of the church;
 such [[agreement]]s were necessary be-
 cause there were few priests around. Af-
 ter the North West Company merged
 with the [[Hudson's\ Bay]] Company in
 1821, HBC policy required a marriage
 contract to be signed by both bride and
 groom in the presence of witnesses.
 Sometimes there was no option but to
 be married à la façon du paysy because
 some men had legitimate wives in their
 countries of origin. Marriages did not
 always include an exchange of vows

  The [[Hudson's\ Bay]] Company established [[Fort]] Nisqually as a fur-trading post in
 1833. In 1840-41 the company transferred the fort to the Puget Sound Agricultural
 Company, which moved the post in 1843. This map shows the two locations of the
 fort and its outlying farms - Tlithlow, Old Muck, and New Muck - in relation to
 some present-day cities, [[Fort]] Lewis, and the Nisqually reservation. (Bill Nelson)
 such as we would recognize today, but
 they were solemnized in other ways,
 usually according to the tribal rituals of
 the wife.
 When the Catholic missionaries Father
 Modeste Demers and Father François
 Norbert Blanchet arrived in the Pacific
 Northwest in 1838, one of their first acts
 was to legitimate country marriages
 and thereby any children already born
 within these relationships. The advent
 of marriages sanctioned by priests or
 justices of the peace reflected the emer-
 gence of a dominant white power struc-
 ture in [[Hudson's\ Bay]] Company society.
 Earlier, frontier conditions had pre-
 cluded simply transferring [[British]] cus-
 toms and models to the new society.
 Survival and economic success were of
 foremost importance during the ex-
 pansion period, so these [[British]] men
 had little opportunity to implement the
 cultural and social structures of their
 homeland. As a result, HBC employees
 had accepted or adopted those [[Indian]]
 ways of life that were the least foreign to
 them.6 However, as more [[Hudson's\ Bay]]
 men settled down and as communica-
 tion routes improved, fort life began to
 replicate life in middle-class Victorian
 Britain. It was at this time that white
 women began to join their husbands at
 the forts in greater numbers.
 Women, whether [[Native]], mixed blood,
 or white, were increasingly considered
 the adjuncts of men and expected to be
 virtuous, domestic, gentle, passive, and
 quiet. When the chief factor at Red
 River, Donald McKenzie, described his
 Swiss-born wife's virtues in a letter to
 his friend, Wilson Price Hunt, he em-
 phasized the fact that she rarely spoke.
 "For you may rely upon it that nothing
 can give greater comfort to a husband
 than the satisfaction of having a wife
 who is nearly mute."7 Women were also
 expected to be pious, a trait that further
 encouraged their submissiveness.
 The behavior of the wives of laborers
 came under particular scrutiny at this
 time because working-class women
 and [[Indian]]s were considered inher-
 ently sexual. The common belief was
 that they were capable of being virtuous
 only if their activities were strictly regu-
 lated. Consequently, Victorian society
 exaggerated the importance of chastity
 and virtue. A woman's chastity, and
 hence her body, was not her own to con-
 trol but the property of her father and
 then her husband. The adherence of
 women to the behaviors that identified
 middle-class [[British]] women became of
 primary importance in defining the
 family's social status. Consequently, the
 wives of laborers within the Hudson's
 Bay Company generally emulated these
 behaviors.
 This certainly seemed to be true of the
 [[Native]] and mixed-blood wives of [[Fort]]
 Nisqually laborers. It is difficult to as-
 certain exactly how many [[Native]] or
 mixed-blood women were at the fort
 and outstations because the numbers
 fluctuated each year, but on average
 there were about 60. All of the officers'
 wives were [[Native]] women. Most male
 employees were white, although some
 were mixed blood, some Hawaiian, and
 some [[Native]] American. Initially estab-
 lished as a fur-trading post, the fort was
 transferred to the [[Hudson's\ Bay]] Com-
 pany's subsidiary, the Puget Sound Ag-
 ricultural Company (PSAC), in 1840-
 41. The fort and its outlying farms,
 including Tlithlow, Old Muck, and
 New Muck, were central to the Hud-
 son's Bay Company's livestock- raising
 operations in the 1840s. Farming op-
 erations at the fort and its outstations
 gradually ceased during the 1850s;

 northwest operations.
 are few detailed records about
 the ways in which the [[Native]]
 American wives of laborers lived, be-
 cause of low literacy levels, the fact that
 the [[Native]] American culture tradition-
 ally did not embrace the value of writ-
 ten records, and the unrelenting re-
 sponsibilities of both the laborers and
 their wives. However, what has been re-
 corded by third parties about [[Native]]
 women's characters and behaviors re-
 veals the expectations of [[Hudson's\ Bay]]
 society regarding women and shows
 that [[Native]] and mixed-blood wives did
 seem to take on the behaviors expected
 ofthem.
 Mary Edwards, a Nisqually [[Indian]] and
 niece of the Klickitat chief Owhi, who
 married George Edwards, a gardener
 and laborer at [[Fort]] Nisqually in the
 years 1850-56, was described as "a faith-
 ful and efficient helpmate" to her hus-
 band. Rosa Dean, a Chelicum [[Indian]]
 and the wife of Thomas Aubrey Dean,
 who worked as a laborer at Tlithlow in
 the years 1851-53, was described by the
 [[Fort]] Nisqually clerk Edward Huggins as
 "superior in character." An anonymous
 article published in a local newspaper
 described Rosa as the "best housekeeper
 you ever saw. Folks said that you could
 eat a meal off her kitchen floor." Eliza-
 beth Wren, the mixed-blood wife of
 Charles Wren, laborer at [[Fort]] Nisqually
 in the years 1841-49, insisted on ac-
 ceptable white social behavior. "Mrs.
 Wren was very alert and on the job" and
 "kept a strict law in manners, both at
 table and social room."8
 There was also the expectation that the
 wives of laborers should be industrious,
 filling any spare time with such pur-
 suits as embroidery. Mary Claquldoate,
 the daughter of a Cowlitz [[Indian]] chief
 and the first (and the last) wife of the la-
 borer John McLeod at [[Fort]] Nisqually,
 was seen as an exemplary wife who was
 "always busy, and was an expert
 needlewoman. She did appliqué pillow
 cases, some with [[Indian]] type designs."9
 Betsy (Twadudastut Teoway), the Puyal-
 lup [[Indian]] wife of William Greig, a la-
 borer at the outlying farms in the years
 1 854-59, "became very learned in help-
 ing care for the farm, knowing how to
 cure meat, smoke hams and bacon and
 seeing to the crops. She was very busy to
 her last days."10
 [[Hudson's\ Bay]] Company laborers, like
 their superiors, believed it necessary to
 assimilate their mixed-blood daughters
 as well, in order to help them contract
 advantageous marriages within an in-
 creasingly white society. William Gul-
 lion Young, a laborer at [[Fort]] Nisqually
 in the years 1850-59, was the sole
 teacher of his mixed-blood daughter,
 Janet, after his wife left him and re-
 turned to her tribe. It is very apparent
 that he was bringing her up as a true
 [[Scottish]] lass.
 He taught her to read and write, how to
 make patchwork quilts
 how to dance the Highland Fling . . . [and]
 how to can fruit, make jam and jellies, make
 pickles, and bake pies beautifully. . . . Her
 father taught her to knit and to weave, and
 how to mend her clothes, and that her
 darning must be perfect. If she misse [d] or
 dropped a single stitch she would have to
 take it all out and do over ... in addition to
 cooking, washing clothes and keeping the
 cabin clean. . . . He taught her how to card
 wool, make yarn from it, use the spinning
 wheel, as well as to knit . . . [and] how to dye
 the yarn with berry juices. . . . [He] taught
 Janet the Ten Commandments, the Golden
 Rule, and shared favorite Scripture verses
 with her.11
 Some of the impetus for the accultura-
 tion of [[Native]] women came from the
 company. As early as 1828, the com-
 pany had recommended that all man-
 ner of "irregularity, vicious, immoral or
 indolent habits, particularly among the
 women and children" be suppressed at
 company forts.12 The [[Native]] wives of
 officers also attempted to encourage
 compliance with Victorian moral ex-
 pectations. Helene McDonald - the
 wife of William Kittson, who was in
 charge of [[Fort]] Nisqually from 1834 to
 1840 - put her energies into converting
 the Sequalitchew band of Nisqually In-
 dians to Roman Catholicism. She also
 encouraged women to replace their ce-
 dar bark with clothing made from ani-
 mal skin and then with a style of dress
 worn by [[Indian]]s in the [[Columbia]] Pla-
 teau that covered the breasts. In 1840
 the missionary Modeste Demers re-
 corded, "Mrs Kitson [sic] having taught
 the [[Indian]] women how to make for
 themselves 'robes' of dressed deer skins,
 they appeared this time dressed as white
 women." Most of the [[Indian]] women
 embraced European fashions with great
 enthusiasm.13
 Bay men were perhaps the
 most instrumental in weaning
 their [[Indian]] wives from their [[Native]]
 habits and in convincing them to ac-
 cept European ways, apparently quite
 oblivious to the fact that refinement
 was impractical in a fur-trading settle-
 ment. Both men and women were
 [[trap]]ped by an ideology that proclaimed
 roles that, particularly in a pioneering
 lifestyle, were at odds with the realities
 of daily life.14 It maybe simplistic, how-
 ever, to suggest that the radical accul-
 turation of [[Native]] and mixed-blood
 wives was primarily due to the desire of
 their husbands to Anglicize them.
 Traditionally, marriage between indi-
 viduals of two different Pacific north-
 west tribes meant that the husband and
 wife would modify their behaviors to
 conform with the expectations of the
 other. Both parties partly took on the
 cultural identity of their spouse. Can
 we then assume that [[Native]] American
 women automatically took on a "white"
 identity upon marriage and no longer
 identified themselves primarily as In-
 dian? Perhaps this question can be an-
 swered by Ellen Flett, the last mixed-
 race wife of the farmer John Flett (who
 worked briefly for the [[Hudson's\ Bay]]
 Company at [[Fort]] Nisqually as a laborer
 in 1842). In the early 20th century,
 Ellen Flett commented, "The squaw[s]
 . . . were always anxious to imitate
 the whites and to learn to be good
 housekeepers."15

  As the [[Hudson's\ Bay]] Company com-
 munities became more settled, women
 could express and recognize their value
 only within the social realm. Their so-
 cial success and economic security be-
 gan to be derived solely through their
 husbands. Unfortunately, this made
 women more vulnerable, and the more
 [[Native]] women became acculturated,
 the more they tried to conform, ulti-
 mately losing some of the advantages
 that had made them so attractive in the
 first place. Their eagerness to accultur-
 ate might also be explained by the fact
 that when white women from Europe
 began arriving at the [[Hudson's\ Bay]] forts,
 [[Native]] and mixed-blood women felt
 their place in fur [[trade]] society was
 threatened.
 With the signing of the Medicine [[Cree]]k
 [[Treaty]] of 1854, it was apparent that the
 old, independent, free-roaming days of
 the Puget Sound tribes were drawing to
 a close. Pollution started to deplete the
 salmon runs and shell[[fish]] beds, the ca-
 mas prairies were fenced and plowed,
 and farmers' hogs rooted up the pre-
 cious edible bulbs. It is not surprising,
 then, that [[Indian]] women tried to
 adapt.16 That they felt the need to do so is
 borne out by the [[Indian]] agent E. A. Star-
 ling. The agent reported to Washington
 Territory's first governor, Isaac Stevens,
 in December 1853 that the [[Indian]]s felt
 that "their destiny is fixed; and that they
 must succumb to the whites . . . they,
 therefore, feel every day, more inclined
 to look to them ... as to what they must
 do."17
 what is surprising is the
 reaction of the white wives of [[Fort]]
 Nisqually laborers to life at the fort.
 Commenting on the trend of bringing
 white wives to the frontier, James Doug-
 las said in 1840, "There is a strange
 revolution in the manners of the coun-
 try; [[Indian]] wives were at one time the
 vogue, the half-breed supplanted these,
 and now we have the lovely tender ex-
 otic torn from its parent bed to pine and
 languish in the desert."18 The "lovely
 tender exotic" hardly describes the
 white women at [[Fort]] Nisqually.
 In November 1850 the newly married
 farm laborer Richard Thornhill and his
 dairymaid wife, Emma (née Kedge),
 from St. Mary Cray in Kent, sailed from
 Gravesend on the Tory to Victoria, Brit-
 ish [[Columbia]], arriving on May 14,
 1851. They likely married for expedi-
 ency rather than love. The Tory had been
 scheduled to leave Gravesend in Sep-
 tember 1850, but it was delayed, and
 Richard and Emma married on Octo-
 ber 15, 1850.19 Agricultural employ-
 ment in Kent had been declining for
 several decades, and the move to a new
 culture and country offered not only
 employment security but also the pos-
 sibility of upward mobility. Certainly
 they would have expected, as citizens of
 the [[British]] Empire, to be treated with a
 level of deference and respect that they
 could never have achieved within the
 [[English]] class system.
 However, instead of embracing the po-
 sition of the white [[colonial]] and working
 to achieve respectability and financial
 stability, Emma seems to have become
 disinhibited by the different cultural
 framework, running away from her
 husband shortly after her arrival. One
 reason for her departure might have
 been the periodic fits of insanity that
 overtook Richard, apparently caused by
 his suffering "a touch of sunstroke in
 the tropics" as they sailed to Vancouver
 Island, but hers was hardly the behavior
 expected of a representative of the Hud-
 son's Bay Company.20 After her husband
 brought her back to the fort, there fol-
 lowed some years of comparative peace
 in Emma Thornhill's life, interrupted
 only by periods of marital discord and
 Richard's occasional fits of insanity.
 What Emma did while at the fort is un-
 clear, although some of the goods
 bought by the Thornhills at the [[trade]]
 shop in the fort indicate that she might
 have worked as a laundress. Or perhaps
 she made and sold candy, because
 she bought an inordinate amount of
 sugar.21 Whatever she did, she appears to
 have been a bit of a spendthrift.
 1856 the company fired Richard,
 and what happened to the Thornhills
 during the next three years is unclear.
 Sometime during 1859, Emma aban-
 doned Richard and reverted to her
 maiden name, identifying herself as a
 spinster despite having two surviving
 sons.22 There is no record of a divorce,
 although divorce was legal in Washing-
 ton Territory. Richard was still in Pierce
 County in May 1859, because he ap-
 pears on the 1859 militia roll, but by the
 end of the year he had gone to [[Canada]].23
 At the end of 1860, Emma had given
 birth to her fourth son, William, giving
 him the surname of Thornhill, al-
 though it seems impossible that Rich-
 ard was the father. It is unclear who
 William's father was, although he may
 have been Russian Orthodox and thus
 perhaps from Russian Alaska: William
 is identified as Russian Orthodox in
 the 1881 census, and the other children
 are identified as Methodist, like their
 parents.24
 On February 9, 1861, Emma commit-
 ted bigamy, marrying another laborer at
 [[Fort]] Nisqually, John McLeod, whose
 [[Indian]] wife Mary Claquldoate had re-
 cently returned to her family.25 What we
 know about John McLeod is not very
 flattering, and so he seems an odd
 choice for a woman who had already
 split up from a husband of dubious and
 unstable character. However, he was
 fairly well-off, which might have been
 the attraction. The pioneer historian
 Ezra Meeker remembered that McLeod
 "used to almost invariably get glori-
 ously drunk whenever he came to
 Steilacoom, which was quite often, and
 generally would take a gallon keg home
 with him full of the vile stuff." However,
 McLeod does seem to have had a trait
 that would have appealed to the appar-
 ently still religious Emma, according to
 Meeker.
 This man was a regular reader of the Bible,
 and, I am told by those who knew his habits
 best, read his chapter as regularly as he drank
 his gill of whiskey, or perhaps more regularly,
 as the keg would at times become dry, while
 his Bible never failed him.26
 98 Pacific 'Northwest Quarterly
  After less than a month, Emma left
 John, very probably leaving her three
 surviving children in his care. On
 March 14, 1861, a notice appeared in a
 local newspaper. "Caution - Whereas
 my wife, Emma Kage, has left my bed
 and board without Cause, notice is
 hereby given that I will pay no debts
 contracted by her. All persons are there-
 fore cautioned against trusting her on
 my account. John McLeod, March 7th,
 1861." She apparently returned to him
 and stayed for a brief period, but on
 January 23, 1862, she divorced him and
 reverted to her maiden name, again
 identifying herself as a spinster.27 What
 she did, and whom she was with during
 the next 10 years is unknown, but on
 November 6, 1872, she committed
 bigamy again, marrying the farmer
 John Craig in the Clinton District of
 [[British]] [[Columbia]] in [[Canada]]. They had a
 civil ceremony, and Emma was again
 listed as a spinster under her maiden
 name on the marriage certificate.28
 Thornhill was not the only
 white woman whose behavior dete-
 riorated on reaching the Pacific North-
 west. The failed East End London busi-
 nessman Thomas Dean and his wife
 Emily, with their two sons, Thomas
 Aubrey and George, were shipmates of
 the Thornhills on the Tory. Thomas
 Dean clearly sailed with the expectation
 of social advancement and upward mo-
 bility. William Fraser Tolmie, who was
 at this time in charge of [[Fort]] Nisqually,
 was due to take over the command of
 [[Fort]] Victoria on Vancouver Island, and
 Thomas Dean had been hired to fill his
 place. However, his talents seem to have
 been overestimated by HBC headquar-
 ters in London. The chief clerk of [[Fort]]
 Nisqually, Edward Huggins, recalled,
 A Mr. Dean, an [[English]]man, who had tried
 and made a failure of several kinds of
 business was sent here. . . . Dean was a
 perfect failure, was almost uneducated, and
 had been more interested in sporting affairs
 than . . . any question relating to farming
 and raising of breeding and rearing
 livestock.29
 When Dean arrived at [[Fort]] Nisqually,
 Huggins reported, "Mr Douglas saw in a
 minute that he was not capable of tak-
 ing Dr. Tolmie's place, so the latter re-
 mained a few years longer at Nis-
 qually."30 Thomas Dean was eventually
 placed at Tlithlow and given the posi-
 tion of farm manager.
 Thomas Dean's exact origins are un-
 clear, but Edward Huggins claimed that
 he was "a broken down old sport, fond
 of horse racing, and especially prize
 [[fight]]ing, and delighted to talk about
 ring celebrities, the Game Chicken,
 Deaf Burke, and many other pugilistic
 celebrities." He had come down in the
 world before his employment with the
 company. Huggins described Dean's
 sons as Cockney, and James Robert
 Anderson remembered his schoolmate
 Thomas Aubrey Dean as "a Young Lon-
 don Street Arab who . . . acted as our
 mentor in the various accomplish-
 ments of the [[English]] street boys besides
 initiating us in their peculiar vocabu-
 lary so that in due time we felt qualified
 to distinguish ourselves in any soci-
 ety."31 Emily Dean (née Joie) was al-
 most certainly the daughter of a clock
 maker in Bath and very probably saw
 her position as wife of an outstation
 farm manager as degrading, especially
 given the likelihood that she had come
 with the hope of social advancement.
 In 1856 the Deans tried to seize control
 of the farm and filed a donation land
 claim on the site. They claimed that the
 seizure was in lieu of back wages, refer-
 ring to their belief that they were owed a
 £125 bonus by the [[Hudson's\ Bay]] Com-
 pany for the completion of five years'
 service. After months of litigation, the
 Deans won the title in the territorial
 court but ultimately lost it.32 We know
 the most about Emily Dean's life during
 this period, because of the journal kept
 at Tlithlow by the farm manager. As
 soon as William Greig took over the
 running of Tlithlow from Dean in No-
 vember 1856, he recorded that Emily
 Dean was threatening to set fire to the
 premises. Three weeks later she physi-
 cally attacked two HBC employees.33
 A month later Greig wrote that when
 some PSAC workers were gathering the
 poultry that belonged to the company,
 "Mrs. Dean . . . abused Mr. Huggins and
 McNeill in particular, in a very unbe-
 coming manner telling McNeill to
 come out and she would thrash his
 jacket for him that he was nothing but a
 nasty catspaw and jackanapes." A few
 days later she came
 running with a stick in her hand to strike A.
 McNeill at the same time calling him a son
 of a b
 unseemly names not fit to come ou woman's mouth. She then fell foul of Mr.
 Huggins, not sparing the Billingsgate. . . .
 Mr. Huggins then told herself that she was a
 disgrace to the place and not fit company for
 [[Indian]] women.34
 Billingsgate was a famous London [[fish]]
 market that had a reputation for filthy
 language; essentially, Greig was com-
 paring Emily Dean's language to that of
 a London [[fish]]wife. On another occasion
 Emily Dean accosted a [[Hudson's\ Bay]]
 Company employee with a gun, threat-
 ening to shoot him if he went anywhere
 near his ox stable, which she had appro-
 priated as her hen house.35 A few years
 later Emily attached herself to an un-
 known man and moved to California.
 She continued to be foul mouthed and
 aggressive, and on March 2, 1866, she
 was committed to the Insane Asylum of
 California at Stockton, where she sub-
 sequently died.36
 Even the third white woman at [[Fort]]
 Nisqually, Eliza Sales, who had little
 time to get into trouble because her
 husband was fired within a year of arriv-
 ing, ran away from her husband when
 they first arrived in the Pacific North-
 west.37 Sales had initially been em-
 ployed at [[Fort]] Victoria, but he trans-
 ferred to [[Fort]] Nisqually after his wife's
 flight.
 is no evidence that the wives of
 laborers found life any harder than
 the wives of independent settlers. In-
 deed, in many ways, their transition to a
 new country was considerably easier.
 Accommodation was provided. It may
 Spring 2005 99
  have been fairly basic, but they did not
 have to set up housekeeping in a tent
 while they built a log cabin. They could
 get basic medical attention at the fort;
 [[food]] was provided to some extent, and
 there was no danger of starving. The
 pain of being severed from families and
 friends must have been experienced by
 all women who moved to the Pacific
 Northwest, and the dislocation that they
 suffered would have been no worse than
 that experienced by American women
 settlers, for whom a return to the East
 Coast would have seemed as impossible
 as a return to England. In addition, here
 was a preexisting community that
 bridged the cultural gap between
 England and the Pacific Northwest.
 However, we find these surprising be-
 haviors only from the wives of Hudson's
 Bay Company laborers at [[Fort]] Nis-
 qually. The wives of laborers at nearby
 [[Fort]] Vancouver, where there were also
 very few white women, do not seem to
 have acted in the same way, though it is
 hard to be sure because the fort's Journal
 of Occurrences has not survived. How-
 ever, there are no references to inappro-
 priate behavior in the letters, diaries, or
 stories of those who spent time at the

 The Thornhills and Deans, and perhaps
 the Saleses, left for [[Fort]] Nisqually with
 the expectation of social advancement.
 It is possible that the working-class
 [[English]] women realized once they had
 moved to the Pacific Northwest that
 they stood little chance of social mobil-
 ity, limited as they were by the Hudson's
 Bay Company class structures, which
 closely replicated those of Victorian
 Britain. They may also have been frus-
 trated by the fact that [[Native]] and mixed-
 blood women, as the wives of officers,
 were their social superiors. Losing their
 hope of social advancement may have
 led them to challenge cultural norms
 and to enjoy instead a level of freedom
 that would have been impossible back
 in England. Whatever the reason, the
 "lovely tender exotics" freed them-
 selves from conforming to expected
 cultural and gender roles.
 In 1827, James Hargraves compared
 the morality of [[Native]] women with that
 of white women. "Most of them with no
 better education than what that light of
 nature teaches lead more innocent
 lives and better fulfil the duties . . . than
 many who in the civilized world call
 themselves [[Christian]]s."39 Though Har-
 graves made this observation more than
 20 years earlier, it seems to apply to the
 wives of laborers at [[Fort]] Nisqually in
 the 1850s. There were many pressures
 on [[Native]] American women to con-
 form to a "white" way of life, and al-
 though their desire to acculturate them-
 selves might have been a strong
 inducement, many [[Native]] women rec-
 ognized that their traditional way of life
 was waning and that the transition was
 necessary.

 and is completing her Ph.D. disserta-
 tion on women doctors in the 19th cen-
 tury. She has published several articles
 in Occurrences and the Oxford Diction-
 ary of National Biography (2004) and is
 writing a book on women at the Hud-
 son's Bay Company's [[Fort]] Nisqually.
