 [[Canada]] and the
 Arctic Council
 INTRODUCTION
 The Arctic Council is a high-level, mainly intergovernmental forum  cooperation, coordination, and interaction among Arctic states,1 indigenou groups, and interested parties of two issue areas, sustainable development  the Arctic and the protection and study of the fragile Arctic ecosystem.  council is poorly understood and little advertised. And while it cannot ena binding legislation (except among the member states) or discuss issue military security, these supposed "weaknesses" have actually helped to for consensus in other important issue areas.
 Andrea Charron is a research associate at the Centre for Security and Defence Stu at Carleton University in Ottawa. She would like to acknowledge with gratitude the v thoughtful comments provided by Rob Huebert, Heather Smith, and Timo Kiovurova would also like to thank the staff, faculty, and students at NPSIAfor their guidance support for these past four years, as well as Rima Berns-McGown and Naomi Joseph their indefatigable patience.

 [[Canada]] will assume the two-year rotating position of chair of the council
 after 15 May 2013, following Sweden's second ministerial meeting to be held
 in Kiruna, Sweden. The US will follow as chair in 2015. It seeks to outline
 the role of the Arctic Council and the role of its chair. It also explores the
 products and outputs of the council and the perennial challenges it faces.
 Finally, it suggests the possible issue areas on which [[Canada]] and the US may
 wish to concentrate during their terms, focusing on the contribution [[Canada]]
 can make especially in the areas of human health and development as
 [[Canada]] shepherds the start of the second decade of Arctic Council business.
 THE ARCTIC COUNCIL: WHAT IS IT?
 The Arctic Council was established in 1996 by means of the Ottaw Declaration. The council's mandate broadened a pre-existing cooperative and environmentally-focused declaration on the protection of the Arcti environment signed in 1991. The Arctic environmental protection strategy,2
 a Finnish initiative with considerable Canadian contribution,3 established four environmental working groups and a sustainable development task
 force. The eight Arctic states,4 observers, and Arctic indigenous groups sent experts to assist the working groups with their studies and projects 2 The objectives of the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy were: i) to protect th Arctic ecosystem including humans; ii) to provide for the protection, enhancement and restoration of environmental quality and the sustainable utilization of natural
 [[resources]], including their use by local populations and indigenous peoples in th Arctic; iii) to recognize and, to the extent possible, seek to accommodate the
 traditional and cultural needs, values and practices of the indigenous peoples, as determined by themselves, related to the protection of the Arctic environment; iv) to
 review regularly the state of the Arctic environment; and v) to identify, reduce, and,
 as a final goal, eliminate pollution. See "Objectives," Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy , Rovaniemi, Finland, 14 June 1991, 9.

 4 These are [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and th US - by fact of geographical proximity to the Arctic Ocean. However, as Timo Koivurova notes, there was no clear idea about what criteria would be used for membership Generally the Arctic Circle was a starting-point.

 Recommendations and scientific reports were written on a range of Arctic
 environmental issues, including universal issues, such as the impact of
 pollution on fragile Arctic ecosystems and more focused studies on state-
 specific issues, such as the impacts of nuclear waste in Russia's Arctic.
 [[Canada]] advocated the transformation of the Arctic environmental
 protection strategy into an organization that would include the existing
 strategy working groups and their programs, but would also address a
 broader range of Arctic issues. Thus, the mandate of the Arctic Council
 includes "common Arctic issues, in particular issues of sustainable
 development and environmental protection in the Arctic..."5 Excluded,
 however, are "matters related to military security." In addition, and most
 significantly, Arctic indigenous groups were given privileged membership
 to ensure that their voices were included in discussions. As a result, the
 Arctic Council has various levels of membership - a practice developed in
 the Arctic environmental protection strategy. Those with voting privileges
 and the ability to determine policy and to make project-related decisions
 include the eight Arctic Member States - all of which were members of the
 Arctic environmental protection strategy.
 The indigenous groups are afforded the status of "permanent
 participants," a role more significant than usually afforded them at the UN
 and other multilateral meetings (Koivurova and Heinamaki 2006). While
 permanent participants do not have a vote, their status is meant to ensure
 their full consultation prior to the forming of decisions based on consensus.
 The six permanent participants are the Aleut International Association,
 the Arctic Athabaskan Council, the Gwich'in Council International, the
 Inuit Circumpolar Council, the Saami Council, and the Russian Arctic
 [[Indigenous]] Peoples of the North. Arctic states and permanent participants
 may participate in all meetings and activities of the Arctic Council and may
 be represented by a head of delegation (referred to as the senior Arctic
 official) and such other representatives as each Arctic state and permanent
 participant deems necessary.

 Ottawa, 19 September 1996. The Arctic environmental protection strategy did list under
 its "principles" areas of concern other than strictly environmental ones: "Consideration
 of the health, social, economic and cultural needs and values of indigenous peoples
 shall be incorporated into management, planning and development activities". See
 "Principles," 10.

 The next membership level is the category of "observers," which include
 non- Arctic states (there are six),6 international organizations (there are nine),7
 and nongovernmental organizations (there are n).8 Observers are invited to
 ministerial and other meetings of the Arctic Council.9 How long observer
 status is continued is not specifically stated; presumably, it continues so long
 as there is consensus among the eight Arctic states. Observers may make
 statements at the discretion of the chair and submit relevant documents to
 the meetings. Non-Arctic states and organizations not yet deemed observers
 are welcome to apply to the chair of the council in writing, outlining their
 potential contribution to the council.10 The applications are reviewed and a
 final decision is made by consensus among the Arctic states.
 There are ad hoc observers that may attend council meetings as well.
 This status is conferred upon interested parties, usually by meeting topic, by
 invitation or formal request to the chair. Some ad hoc members, for example,
 China and the EU, attend council meetings on a fairly regular basis, for
 example, China and the EU.
 6 They are France, [[German]]y, Poland, the UK, the Netherlands, and Spain. ([[German]]y,
 Poland, the UK, and the Economic Commission for Europe were also instrumental in
 preparing the Arctic environmental protection strategy.)
 7 They are the International Federation of Red Cross & Red Crescent Societies, the
 International Union for the Conservation of Nature, the Nordic Council, the Nordic
 Environment Finance Corporation, the North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission,
 the Standing Committee of the Parliamentarians of the Arctic Region, the United
 Nations Economic Commission for Europe, the United Nations Development
 Program, and the United Nations Environment Program. Note that the International
 Maritime Organization is not an observer to the Arctic Council.
 8 They are the advisory committee on protection of the seas, the Arctic Circumpolar
 Gateway, the Association of World Reindeer Herders, the Circumpolar Conservation
 Union, the International Arctic Science Committee, the International Arctic Social
 Sciences Association, the International Union forCircumpolar Health, the International
 Work Group for [[Indigenous]] Affairs, the Northern Forum, the University of the Arctic,
 and the World Wide Fund for Nature-Global Arctic Program.

 ROLE OF THE CHAIR OF THE ARCTIC COUNCIL
 The Arctic Council is guided by its "Rules of Procedure"11 and "Terms
 of Reference for a Sustainable Development Program."12 The rules of
 procedure apply to all bodies of the council and specify how meetings are
 run and how decisions are made and outlines the role of the chair. The chair
 is assumed by an Arctic State (and host country) for two years. The role of
 the chair is largely focused on transactions. The host country is the conduit
 for information received from and delivered to all Arctic states, permanent
 participants, and observers, preferably via a central point of contact. The
 main administrative responsibility is to organize at least one ministerial
 meeting, often annual deputy meetings, and at least two senior Arctic official
 meetings during which decisions are made regarding the scope of projects,
 funding, and the like. After consulting with Arctic states and permanent
 participants, the host country may place limits on the size of delegations for
 the meetings. The chair also consults on and circulates draft agenda prior to
 ministerial meetings.
 The host country is responsible for organizing the meetings, providing
 translation services and other such tasks, all of which may leave one with the
 impression that the chair is no more than a glorified administrator. However,
 by drafting the agenda, especially prior to the ministerial meetings at which
 decisions are made and voted on, the host country has an opportunity to
 suggest new issues to be explored by the working groups, to set an ambitious
 and active agenda, and to work toward major decisions that can impact many
 in the Arctic. For example, the recently signed Agreement on Cooperation
 on Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue in the Arctic, which
 coordinates life-saving international maritime and aeronautical search and
 rescue coverage and response among the Arctic states across an area 33
 million square kilometers, was the result of an initiative decided at the 2009
 ministerial meeting in Tromso, Norway (the chair), establishing a search
 and rescue task force, co-chaired by the United States and the Russian
 Federation.
 Beginning with the chair of Norway in 2006, a seven-year "Scandinavian"
 term was launched. The chairs of Norway (2006-March 2009), [[Denmark]]
 (2009-2011), and Sweden (2011-2013) hoped to maximize their potential to
 effect real change in the Arctic by setting common priorities over the three
 terms. The advantage of a coordinated agenda is that longer-term and more
 il See annex i to senior Arctic officials, 1998, www.arctic-council.org.
 12 See www.arctic-council.org.
 I International journal | Summer 2012 | 769 |

 complicated projects can be tackled and that momentum can be sustained,
 allowing projects to come to fruition. Coordinated agenda also allow the
 council to secure funding for projects (mostly from the Arctic states) over
 a longer term and to seek multiple funding agencies given the benefit of
 time. The disadvantage is that if the agenda do not align or if cooperation
 cannot be achieved among the chairs, then the council's project planning
 and decision making can be disrupted for a longer period. To the credit of
 the Scandinavian chairs, they have coordinated their agenda very well and
 have not focused solely on Scandinavian issues - something that would be
 counter to the spirit of this forum. Instead, the agenda have pushed for a
 permanent secretariat, the completion of the important search and rescue
 [[agreement]], and the continuation of ongoing projects.
 WHAT ARE THE ARCTIC COUNCIL'S "PRODUCTS" AND "OUTPUTS"?
 The main "products" of the Arctic Council are policy recommendati and guidelines. These are usually drawn from the assessments (as well discussions, results, and projects) of the Arctic Council's six working grou ad hoc task forces, and expert groups. The six working groups include  four Arctic environmental-protection strategy working groups, namely: t protection of the Arctic marine environment (currently chaired by Icelan the Arctic monitoring and assessment program (currently chaired b Canadian), the conservation of Arctic flora and fauna (currently chair by a Russian); and the emergency prevention, preparedness, and respo working group (currently chaired by a Norwegian). In order to reflect the broader mandate of the Arctic Council, two additional groups have be added: the sustainable development working group (chaired by a Swe and the Arctic contaminants action program (chaired by a Russian). E working group has a chair, management board, or steering committee and supported by a secretariat offered by a state member. For instance, the Arc monitoring and assessment program secretariat has always been located . Oslo and has, according to Timo Koivurova, been hugely influential throug various chairships.) Working Groups generally meet several times a year to assess progress and advance its work. The protection of the Arctic mar environment group, for example, is headed by a chair and vice-chair, whic rotate among the Arctic countries. The chair reports to the senior Ar officials, and through them, to the ministers of the Arctic Council.
 The working groups (task forces and other subsidiary bodies) ma establish their own operating guidelines, but the composition and mandate of such bodies must be agreed to by the Arctic states. Many of the reports  I 770 I Summer 2012 | International Journal |
  I [[Canada]] and the Arctic Council |
 studies conducted by the working groups are now touchstone documents; for
 example, the 2004 Arctic climate impact assessment, a collaborative project
 led by a steering committee of members from the conservation of Arctic
 flora and fauna group, the Arctic monitoring and assessment program, the
 International Arctic Sciences Committee (an observer), and experts from
 around the world, is widely read by states, NGOs, and academics worldwide.
 The assessments serve not only to educate the wider public, but to report
 on important and rigorously tested scientific findings. The working groups
 also conduct many studies about preparing for the future. The Arctic marine
 shipping assessment, for example, engaged a private company to assist
 the protection of the Arctic marine environment group to create "scenario
 narratives" on the future of Arctic marine navigation via a process of scenario
 planning, in order to challenge wishful thinking and to provide an academic
 framework with which to plan for the future of Arctic marine shipping.13
 The Arctic Council does not and cannot, given its current mandate,
 coordinate or enforce its guidelines or decisions - that is the purview of
 individuals states.14 Even the search and rescue [[agreement]], which is an
 [[agreement]] of the eight Arctic states and not the Arctic Council, is only
 actionable by the parties. (The Arctic Council does not have its own coast
 guard, military, or police force.) Given that the Arctic, an ocean, is governed
 by a number of binding international instruments - most importantly,
 the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea - it hasn't been necessary for
 the Arctic Council to consider pursuing a more robust raison d'etre. This
 apparent weakness is arguably the Council's strength; its guidelines and
 recommendations are derived from systematic study through the working
 groups and then adopted by consensus by the eight Arctic states.
 The theoretical likelihood that the guidelines and policies are adopted
 by the member states should be high, given that these guidelines and
 policies are reached after much discussion and input from the permanent
 participants, observers, ad hoc observers, academics, and experts. Sadly,
 the lack of interest and knowledge about the Arctic Council generally
 means that only a few experts, academics, and practitioners are aware of
 the guidelines, and so the adoption rates are considerably lower than the
 13 For an explanation of the process, see the Global Business Network's "Scenario
 Narratives Report," www.arctic-council.org.
 14 This case has many organizations with state membership - it is the members and
 not the organization that give effect to the decisions made. Nothing is preventing the
 Arctic Council from adopting "soft" monitoring mechanisms.

 theoretical expectation. On the other hand, the fact that the council works
 on the basis of consensus means that the subject, scope, and direction of
 projects, while often reflective of pressing Arctic issues, can exclude or
 limit the study of particularly contentious ones. For example, [[fish]]eries and
 marine species management in the Arctic are viewed by many as important
 emerging issues but have yet to be addressed in a profound way. That
 being said, the Arctic Council is lauded by many as a resounding success
 for the cooperation it engenders and the serious scientific and policy study
 undertaken by its working groups, whose products, like the 2009 report on
 best practices in ecosystem-based oceans management in the Arctic,15 serve
 to inform and influence the behaviour of Arctic and non- Arctic states.
 PERENNIAL ARCTIC COUNCIL CHALLENGES
 The Arctic Council has been plagued by coordination and funding issue from the beginning. A ten-year review conducted by Timo Koivurov and David VanderZwaag16 and taking into account various other studies identifies several challenges, including the fact that working groups tend t compete for the same pots of money. The member states make volunta contributions and supply individuals, equipment, and experts in kind Given the current financial crunch faced by many states, such discretionar spending is always in danger of being cut. This is especially a concern f the permanent participants, who are often dependent on Arctic states f a variety of sources of funding not only to participate actively at coun meetings and to finance the indigenous peoples' secretariat, but also to help
 to fund and provide services to their peoples in their respective homelands. Another problem is the division of labour, not just among the various working groups (naturally, their respective areas of study are n neatly partitioned), but also between the Arctic Council and other bodie 15 On the basis of the mandate given at the Salekhard ministerial in 2006, th Norwegian chairship of the Arctic Council initiated a project on oceans managemen This project was undertaken as an approved project of the Arctic Council sustainab development working group in collaboration with the protection of Arctic marin environment group. See www.arctic-council.org.

VanderZwaag, "The Arctic Council at io Year Retrospects and Prospects," University of [[British]] [[Columbia]] Law Review (2007): 121-194 17 For example, the Arctic Athabaskan Council authored a report: "Improving t Efficiency and Effectiveness of the Arctic Council: A Discussion Paper," March 200 www.arctic-council.org.
 I 772 I Summer 2012 | International journal |
  I [[Canada]] and the Arctic Council |
 especially the UN, think tanks, and universities. The concern is that
 multiple organizations are conducting similar types of studies, and so the
 same issues are analyzed by multiple groups. Coordinating the various
 projects and analyses to minimize the impact on the Arctic (for example,
 can "samples" be collected by one source and divided among the various
 groups? Or can new, less intrusive methods be established?) is a perennial
 challenge. The goal of the international polar year (March 2007 to March
 2009) was to minimize this overlap while maximizing the range of studies
 conducted. Now that the polar year is over, the concern is that a) either
 the worlďs attention will turn away from the Arctic (less likely) or that b)
 the coordinating and collaboration of studies will be negatively impacted
 (more likely). Indeed, one of [[Canada]]'s goals, outside of the Arctic Council,
 may be to push for the UN to recognize an "International Polar Decade"
 to encourage continued world-wide attention and funding for study of the
 Arctic and Antarctica.18
 Related to the coordination issue is the fact that the role of the Arctic
 Council is poorly understood and relatively unknown around the world. While
 its documents are read and used, the council has not advertised its role in
 the creation of the documents. It lacks a broad communication strategy. The
 permanent secretariat will help in that regard to disseminate information
 more widely. At the November 2009 senior Arctic officials meeting, the
 Danish Chair asked [[Canada]] to lead a contact group made up of interested
 member states, permanent participants, working groups and the temporary
 Arctic Council secretariat to create working group communication plans
 and improve the Arctic Council's website, etc. The draft of "Arctic Council
 Communications and Outreach Guidelines" was submitted to ministers for
 approval in an appendix to the Nuuk Declaration in 2 on. Continued work
 on education and outreach, however, is needed.
 As with any organization with member states, national interests are
 the big elephants in the room that cannot be avoided, but rather, must
 be embraced. This makes it more challenging for the council to make
 recommendations on particularly contentious issues (like [[fish]]ing, for
 example). The cooperative and conflict avoidance mantra of the Arctic
 Council (confirmed by a recent declaration of the five littoral Arctic states
 18 [[Canada]] is only a non-consultative party in the Antarctic treaty system, whereas
 the next chair of the Arctic Council, the US, is both consultative party and the host of
 the negotiations that led to the 1959 Antarctic treaty and a full member of the treaty.
 If [[Canada]] is looking to find opportunities to support US interests, this is an obvious
 issue area.

 in Ilulisaat in 2008) is still intact. One area that was thought to be verboten
 was that of matters related to military security. However, given that the
 recent search and rescue [[agreement]] signed by the Arctic states necessitates
 the coordination of the states' military, coast guard, police, and transport
 services for rescue purposes, hard security may be entering into the agenda
 by stealth, suggesting that the Arctic Council is able to put need ahead of
 politics - a good sign of the Council's continued "cooperation... based on
 mutual trust and transparency."19
 The lack of a standing or permanent secretariat was a major issue,
 but this has been solved. During the Danish chairship, the Arctic Council
 approved the establishment of a secretariat to be operational no later than
 the beginning of the Canadian term in 2013. The secretariat will (initially)
 be a body of up to ten staff members (not including translators), headed by
 a director. The secretariat may host secondments and internships, including
 in particular those of permanent participants. Sweden is to lead a task force
 that will review, negotiate, and propose terms of reference, work plans,
 and working methods for the new Arctic Council secretariat. A permanent
 secretariat will help to preserve organizational memory, and it should remove
 some of the administrative burdens from the chair, who will then focus more
 intently on the quality, direction, and scope of the council's working agenda
 beyond a two-year horizon. The secretariat will perform functions in four
 broad categories: 1) communications, 2) administrative and other duties,
 3) finance and human [[resources]], and 4) translation. The new challenge
 will be coordinating communication between the secretariat and the chair.
 Generally, the temporary secretariat has communicated very well with the
 chair in Oslo, Copenhagen, and now Stockholm by daily email exchanges
 and telephone and video conferences, as necessary. Given technology today
 and the fact that the Arctic Council's very existence is based on dealing with
 and thriving in distant locales, this is unlikely to be a major issue.
 CANADA'S CONTRIBUTION
 [[Canada]] assumed the inaugural chair of the Arctic Council in 1998 an hold the chair again in 2013 until 2015, followed by the US until 2017. T council has been in existence for sixteen years, and given that Canad mark the start of a new cycle of chairs among the eight Arctic states,  an appropriate time to reflect on what is and is not working. There are hard and fast rules that dictate the projects and agenda any host co 19 Ilulisaat Declaration, 2008, www.oceanlaw.org.
 I 774 I Summer 2012 | International Journal |
  I [[Canada]] and the Arctic Council |
 sets for the council (subject to them being within the realm of Arctic-related
 issues and by [[agreement]] of the other Arctic states) and so [[Canada]] has an
 opportunity to tackle issues of particular concern to it. And given that [[Canada]]
 sought to broaden the issues addressed by the Arctic Council to include
 social, cultural, and other challenges beyond the strictly environmental, it
 is logical that [[Canada]]'s priorities would continue to reflect this predilection.
 Certainly, on paper, [[Canada]]'s second, third, and fourth priorities outlined in
 its Northern Strategy20 include promoting social and economic development,
 protecting its environmental heritage, and improving and devolving
 Northern governance, all of which are consistent with the goals and spirit of
 the Arctic Council.
 Before we turn to the particulars of the agenda, however, there are some
 "domestic" issues that need to be acknowledged. First, successive Canadian
 governments have made securing "sovereignty" in the North a priority; in
 fact, it is the number one priority of [[Canada]]'s Northern Strategy. Issues in
 this category, however, cannot be tackled within the current mandate of the
 Arctic Council, nor should they. [[Canada]] continues to have dis[[agreement]]s
 with the US21 and [[Denmark]],22 but they are managed dis[[agreement]]s. Such
 issues are what the "Artie five" had in mind when they drafted the Ilulisaat
 Declaration in 2008. Continued progress via diplomatic and political
 means is the pledged modus operandi of the states in question and is to be
 encouraged.
 Second, [[Canada]] is a party to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea
 and is proceeding with its plan to make a submission of scientific data to the
 UN commission on the limits of the continental shelf by December 2013
 to (hopefully) agree to eventually recognize [[Canada]]'s extended outer limits
 of its subsoil territory on its Arctic and Atlantic coasts. [[Canada]] is working
 cooperatively with the Danes and the US to conduct the scientific surveys.
 This process is separate from the Arctic Council, however. Member states
 of the UN convention understand this, but there is confusion among the
 domestic public for a variety of reasons (government rhetoric, skewed media
 reports, and confusion and dis[[agreement]]s among academics, lawyers,
 20 Department of [[Indian]] Affairs and Northern Development, "[[Canada]]'s Northern
 Strategy: Our North, Our Heritage, Our Future," 2009, www.northernstrategy.gc.ca.
 21 These dis[[agreement]]s concern the Dixon Entrance and the Beaufort Sea. [[Canada]]
 and the United States also dispute the status of the Northwest Passage.
 22 These dis[[agreement]]s are over Hans Island in the Kennedy Channel between
 Ellesmere Island and Greenland.
 I International journal | Summer 2012 | 775 |

 etc.) about the UN process and the role of the Arctic Council. The myriad
 government agencies and departments with mandates in the North is
 growing and not well understood or explained. For example, while most
 Canadians would likely assume that the newly named [[Aboriginal]] Affairs
 and Northern Development [[Canada]] would have the lead for [[Canada]]'s Arctic
 Council business, it is, in fact, the Department of Foreign Affairs and
 International Trade (DFAIT). And while [[Aboriginal]] Affairs and Northern
 Development and DFAIT work together, DFAIT [[resources]] and attention to
 the Arctic Council must compete with many other departmental priorities,
 such as submissions to the UN commission.
 Third, and most importantly, [[Canada]] needs to continue to work in the
 Canadian north with northerners to create sustainable communities. Statistic
 after statistic decries the dangerous living conditions and high homelessness
 rates, the high rates of suicide, the lack of employment opportunities,
 especially for the youth, the lack of mental health services, and sky-rocketing
 cases of diabetes, tuberculosis, and other diseases, not to mention substance
 abuse. [[Canada]]'s less than stellar commitment to reduction of greenhouse
 gases is also problematic (including withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol).
 [[Canada]] will have far less credibility pushing for an ambitious Arctic Council
 agenda that focuses on the environment and northerners if it has not made
 any progress at home.23 Besides which, an ambitious agenda may not be in
 [[Canada]]'s national interest. An agenda that embraces the spirit of "liberal
 realism," Kim Richard Nossal counsels, is the safer bet - the middle road
 between sanctimonious idealism and hard-core realism.24
 So what might be some of the priorities for [[Canada]]'s Arctic Council
 agenda for 2013 to 2015? First, while it is not required, there may be great
 benefit to coordinating our priorities with those of the US to establish a
 North American agenda. This gives [[Canada]] and the US four years to set
 23 Surprisingly, northern Canadians are generally more optimistic than southern
 Canadians when it comes to their health and quality of life. See Ekos Research,

 submitted to the Walter and Duncan Gordon Foundation and the [[Canada]] Centre for
 Global Security Studies at the Münk School of Global Affairs, January 2011, www.
 gordonfoundation.ca. The survey does not measure the actual levels of poor health,
 which are well documented in the north.

 more stable and predictable project timelines and funding. Given recent
 statements by the US government,25 it is clear that the Arctic is increasingly a
 priority, but not necessarily via the Arctic Council, unless it is in concert with
 all of the Arctic states along agreed areas of concern (namely cooperation on
 the environment and sustainable development). Time for planning a four-
 year agenda is running out quickly. And making too ambitious an agenda
 may not be in the national interests of [[Canada]] or the US.
 What the US and [[Canada]] want to avoid is for the Arctic Council to
 become a UN-like body with so many priorities, working groups, observers
 etc., that the modest, but important advancements made to date are lost
 or overshadowed. While the Arctic Council was formed by a declaration,
 it cannot operate separately from the eight Arctic states nor can it obligate
 other states or organizations to take specific measures. Even the latest search
 and rescue arrangement is one of the Arctic states and not of the Arctic
 Council. The Arctic environmental protection strategy declaration and the
 Ottawa declaration use "soft," nonbinding language and dispute resolution is
 not covered specifically in either document. Indeed, according to Koivurova
 and Vanderzwaag, the Arctic Council is expected to continue to maintain its
 role as a forum for discussion rather than a forum for governance.26 They
 point to fluctuating government priorities, the two-year rotation of state
 chairs, changing science and yearly priority issues, the influence of other
 organizations and resistance of member states to stronger Arctic states as
 impediments to an increased role for the council.27
 That being said, the involvement of ministers of state and DFAIT has
 increased the priority and focus of the Arctic Council, which may mean the
 council morphs into an international organization. On the one hand, the
 ministerial-level (and now deputy-ministerial) involvement means that more
 [[resources]] can be pledged and greater impetus given to council projects.28 It

 are considered and are ultimately placed before the ministers for decision. The
 underlying rationale is that all cooperative activities must be pursuant to a ministerial
 mandate. Certain states, like the US, insist this approach reinforces the role of the
 council as a forum for exchanging views and does not make it an operational body.

 also means binding decisions can be made among the eight Arctic states (and
 again we return to the "status" question of the Council). On the other hand,
 the "bottom-up" process of consultation and discussion with permanent
 participants and the Arctic states can be frustrated in preparation for an
 agenda for ministerial decision-making. Further complicating the decision-
 making is the potential inclusion of more voices.
 The issue of observers is likely to continue to be a contentious one. While
 the Arctic Council has now agreed to criteria for admitting observers and a
 role for their participation in its affairs,29 there is concern, especially among
 some of the permanent participants, that potential applicants like China, the
 EU, Japan, South Korea, and Italy, will drown out their voices - especially
 China (representing 1.3 billion people) and the EU (representing twenty-
 seven states) - with commercial interests in the Arctic, some of which are
 antithetical to the practices of indigenous peoples of the north (such as a ban
 on the sale of seal meat).
 The Arctic Council, therefore, is at a stage at which representatives must
 think through the ramifications of a growing membership and growing
 agenda. [[Canada]] needs to be clear about what it wants as the next round of
 applications will come on [[Canada]]'s watch. Are Canadian and US positions
 aligned? For now, [[Canada]] has been firm saying no to the EU (less so to
 China), but what about other applicants? Does saying "no" continue to serve
 [[Canada]]'s interests? For example, [[Canada]], China, and South Korea all belong
 to the voluntary North Pacific coast guard forum,30 along with the US, Russia,
 and Japan, to share information about [[fish]]eries and trafficking of people
 and drugs. Why, some may ask, can [[Canada]] work with China in one related
 context and not others? Does [[Canada]] know the true intentions of the would-
 be applicants? Would giving permanent participants a vote, for example,
 given their special status and obvious interest in the Arctic, counter possible
 EU or China membership (both their application and future decisions as
 observers on the council?) Or should the votes rest with the eight states
 (who are ultimately responsible for implementing decisions made)? Will the
 success and scientific work of the council be lost should the council grow, or
 will it be strengthened - especially because of the increase in funds available
 that come with observers? Is it simply a matter of limiting the physical

 number of representatives observers may bring to the meetings (normally in
 small and remote northern towns)? Or is membership on the Arctic Council
 a right of all states and organizations in the world with an "interest" in the
 Arctic? Can [[Canada]] use observer membership on the Arctic Council to
 tackle other, more contentious issues, e.g., is the Arctic Council a backdoor
 to discussions with potential candidates, like China, on other geopolitical
 issues? Or does [[Canada]] suggest a freeze on all additional state observers
 in favour of organizations (like the IMO, for example). As chair, [[Canada]]
 will need to rediscover its diplomatic fortitude. This issue has the potential
 to divide the Arctic Council, which is antithetical to the whole purpose of
 the council mandated to create cooperation. Having a clear position before
 2013 means [[Canada]] is less likely to make precipitous decisions and to be
 challenged while chair.
 Regardless of these largely systemic debates, the business of the Arctic
 Council is practical. There are more than enough issues facing the Arctic
 on which [[Canada]] and the US can agree. The challenge will be not to find
 common issues but to focus the agenda.
 [[Canada]] will be the first chair to have a permanent secretariat at its
 disposal. And while there will be an adjustment period as the secretariat
 settles into the day-to-day business of the council (not completely foreign, as
 a temporary secretariat has been in place for several years and the Swedish
 chair will develop operating procedures for the secretariat), it affords [[Canada]]
 and the U S the opportunity to begin to tackle the list of "perennial" challenges
 to the council. To date, the working groups have set their own agenda and
 plans of action (with approval of the senior Arctic officials), and this has
 worked reasonably well. The communication among the working groups,
 however, can be hit or miss. The proposed "outreach" program of the council
 needs to continue, but not just via draft communication guidelines and with
 other international organizations (e.g., many of the environmentally focused
 UN organizations). Rather, [[Canada]] and the US can continue the work of the
 Swedish chair to encourage active involvement with think tanks, universities,
 and academics around the world (including North America)31 and to
 continue to provide support to the sustaining Arctic observing networks
 initiative.32 As well, the Arctic monitoring and assessment program working
 31 Ibid. See "Communications and Outreach," section 2.2. Given the concentration of
 European Arctic states, European think tanks are generally better represented.

 group suggested that the Arctic Council work with the Association of Polar
 Early Career Scientists to involve their scientists in working group activities.
 [[Aboriginal]] youth should also be encouraged to participate in a similar and
 meaningful way.
 The impact of climate change on the Arctic will continue to be an ongoing
 priority and concern and both [[Canada]] and the US support the council's
 Arctic change assessment due to begin in 2015. Endorsing, disseminating,
 and responding to the report (in the form of policy recommendations for
 Arctic states) will likely be on the agenda for the US from 2015 t020iy.
 But if [[Canada]] is to coordinate an agenda with the US, they should be
 singing from the same song book, if not the same page.
 The US has traditionally seen the Arctic as a security buffer: it has
 forgotten in the past that it is an Arctic nation, but all indications suggest
 change. The US is starting to recognize that a broader idea of security in
 the Arctic espoused by [[Canada]], and ultimately the Arctic Council, is in the
 interest of the US. The US is concerned with the dearth of infrastructure,
 supply problems, and a lack of equipment, personnel, information, and
 Arctic capabilities. While most are US domestic concerns, any opportunity
 for [[Canada]] and the Arctic Council to help the US work toward mutually
 beneficial and self-sustaining programs and policies is to the benefit of
 all. For example, the US is likely to champion further work and study on
 black carbon methane and tropospheric ozone as well as unmanned aircraft
 systems safety guidelines and a cross-jurisdictional flight pilot project. Given
 recent events such as the sinking of the MS Explorer in 2007 in Antarctic
 waters and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico,
 best operating practices for rescue operations and offshore oil and gas
 drilling will be priorities.
 The senior Arctic officials recommended that the ministers mandate
 a task force to develop an international instrument on Arctic marine oil
 pollution preparedness and response and that the emergency prevention,
 preparedness, and response working group, in close collaboration with
 other relevant working groups, develop recommendations and best practices
 in the prevention of marine oil pollution. The results are due in 2013 and
 composed of representatives from the Arctic Council, the International Arctic Science
 Committee, and the World Meteorological Organization. The steering group worked
 most closely with the eight Arctic countries and consulted with experts in community-
 based monitoring and in data management. It created a new website, www.
 arcticobserving.org, which houses some scientific data and inventories of networks,
 but the site still needs to be populated more fully.

 will then need to be adopted and implemented. A similar [[agreement]] to the
 search and rescue [[agreement]] but focusing on Arctic oil spill cleanup efforts
 would be a useful and doable achievement of a "North American" agenda.
 (This is no comment on the capacity of the states to actually be able to clean
 up a spill - more to agree to look at collective capabilities and efforts.) In
 the same vein, an Arctic Protected Areas Network (focusing on areas of the
 Arctic of a particularly sensitive ecological nature) is likely to be the focus of
 the Inuit Circumpolar Council, which the Canadian NGO Inuit Circumpolar
 Council [[Canada]] chairs in 2014, and a decision on mandatory polar shipping
 code with the International Maritime Organization is due in 2013. Indeed,
 keeping track of the various initiatives and which organization is doing what
 will require constant tracking by the chair of the Arctic Council.
 [[Canada]] could make a significant contribution with respect to the latest
 area to arrive on the Council's agenda - public health. This is especially
 the case given that [[Canada]]'s chair is [[Canada]]'s Minister of Health and the
 Minister of the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency, Leona
 Aglukkaq. Via a series of task forces and special meetings the broad umbrella
 of human security issues is beginning to be addressed more directly by the
 Arctic Council. For example, an Arctic health ministers' meeting was held in
 Nuuk, Greenland, in February 2011. The meeting recognized the continued
 health challenges and noted the need to improve physical and mental health
 and well-being and empowerment of indigenous peoples and residents of
 Arctic communities. This is an area the US and especially [[Canada]] should
 set as an ongoing priority of the council, given that the health disparities
 between indigenous and non-indigenous populations and between
 population groups in different Arctic regions continue to be significant. An
 Arctic human health experts group led by [[Canada]] and Greenland33 is in the
 works.
 Studies on issues including telehealth and telemedicine, nutrition,
 the health and safety of children, and youth of the Arctic (a particularly
 vulnerable and expanding group), proper housing, sanitation, and [[food]]
 and water safety (the latter two being Swedish initiatives) are all priorities.
 The working groups are looking at the impact of environmental toxins and
 contaminants on human health (for example, a 2009 assessment of human
 33 [[Canada]] and Greenland will conduct a comparative review of circumpolar health
 systems report. The purpose of this project is to highlight different responses to
 similar challenges and focus on the effects of differing governance and organization.
 The first phase of this larger, multi-year project entails assembling national and
 regional profiles of the different health systems in Arctic countries.

 health in the Arctic and seminars on suicide prevention), but more focus
 needs to be placed on the nexus between human health and poverty in
 Arctic regions. The US launched the Arctic human health initiative during
 the international polar year, but the studies and journal articles amassed
 along with work completed by a survey of living conditions in the Arctic (a
 Danish/ Greenland initiative) still need to be translated into policy-relevant
 recommendations .
 Whether a new working group is needed (arguably the impacts on health
 is a related subject matter for many of the working groups and so perhaps an
 entirely new one is not needed) or an expanded, targeted task force, is yet to
 be determined. Certainly, there is research available on these issues, but it
 needs to be processed and acted upon. [[Canada]] would be a natural choice to
 heighten the profile of all of these initiatives, which have broad [[agreement]]
 among the council membership, during its chairship. There are other,
 related issues, such as reducing the loss of Arctic indigenous languages,
 strategies for Arctic waste management and advancing the socio-economic
 conditions of [[Indigenous]] Peoples and Arctic communities that are on
 the "to do" list (and on the Inuit Circumpolar Council's list too). Indeed,
 there is an argument to be made that the thematic areas of the sustainable
 development working group,34 including: Arctic human health, Arctic
 socio-economic issues, adaptation to climate change, energy and Arctic
 communities, management of natural [[resources]], and Arctic cultures and
 language are quintessential^ Canadian issue areas. This is not to suggest
 that the projects of the other working groups are not important, but that the
 sustainable development working group represent the issues and priorities
 that are particularly important to aboriginal peoples and therefore, the
 natural choice of priorities for [[Canada]]'s chairship.
 D FAIT has been working to create broad consensus with Canadian
 stakeholders via meetings and many circulating documents to analyze the
 issues of importance for [[Canada]]: is it in [[Canada]]'s national interest, does
 it match current government priorities, what are the risks and benefits to
 [[Canada]] and to [[Canada]]-US relations, etc.? DFAIT is gingerly reaching out to
 the US (and vice versa) to consider joint issues. But these efforts are well-
 kept secrets that can foster mistrust. Canadian academics, for example,
 are keen to see where they might contribute and benefit from research
 opportunities given [[Canada]]'s chairship, for example, a potential Canadian
 research chair in Arctic governance and development. The Scandinavian

 partners, for example, had already articulated a common agenda prior to
 their assumption of the chairship by this point. The big question is where
 the money will come from to chair the council with reasonable distinction
 given this time of fiscal austerity?
 CONCLUSION
 A new cycle of chairs shall begin with [[Canada]]. The agenda of the chairs stayed true to the joint priorities of environmental protection and sustai development. The Arctic Council, through its working groups and forces, has released a number of important assessments on the A and the eight Arctic states have agreed on recommendations and ac to take. The question is how [[Canada]] directs the council's priorities d its chairship. Given [[Canada]] was instrumental to expanding the purv the council beyond the Arctic environmental protection strategy's m environmental focus, it is natural (perhaps even expected) that [[Canada]] f on the [[Aboriginal]] peoples and the issues of particular concern to  in partnership with the US. Indeed, this theme was the focus of G White's presidential address to the Canadian Political Science Associ in 20II.35 No doubt [[Canada]] will be ready, but it is likely to be a rushed  hurried scramble that may miss opportunities and linkages with  Canadian and international initiatives. The hope is that [[Canada]] will  a limited but focused agenda in concert with the US, in keeping w foreign policy tradition, that puts [[Aboriginal]] and northern peoples' first - a domestic imperative and an Arctic Council objective.
