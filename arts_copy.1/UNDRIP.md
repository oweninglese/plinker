An Act respecting the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of [[[[Indigenous]]]] Peoples
<a id="org7ff3a65"></a>
## Preamble
Whereas the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of [[[[Indigenous]]]] Peoples provides a framework for reconciliation, healing and peace, as well as harmonious and cooperative relations based on the principles of justice, democracy, respect for human rights, non-discrimination and good faith;
Whereas the rights and principles affirmed in the Declaration constitute the minimum standards for the survival, dignity and well-being of [[[[Indigenous]]]] peoples of the world, and must be implemented in [[[[Canada]]]];
Whereas, in the outcome document of the high-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly of the United Nations known as the World Conference on [[[[Indigenous]]]] Peoples, [[[[Canada]]]] and other States reaffirm their solemn commitment to respect, promote and advance the rights of [[[[Indigenous]]]] peoples of the world and to uphold the principles of the Declaration;
Whereas, in its document entitled Calls to Action, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of [[[[Canada]]]] calls upon federal, provincial, territorial and municipal governments to fully adopt and implement the Declaration as the framework for reconciliation, and the Government of [[[[Canada]]]] is committed to responding to those Calls to Action;
Whereas, in its document entitled Calls for Justice, the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered [[[[Indigenous]]]] Women and Girls calls upon federal, provincial, territorial, municipal and [[[[Indigenous]]]] governments to implement the Declaration, and the Government of [[[[Canada]]]] is committed to responding to those Calls for Justice;
Whereas First Nations, Inuit and the Métis Nation have, throughout history and to this day, lived in the lands that are now in [[[[Canada]]]] with their distinct identities, cultures and ways of life;
Whereas [[[[Indigenous]]]] peoples have suffered historic injustices as a result of, among other things, colonization and dispossession of their lands, territories and [[[[resources]]]];
Whereas the implementation of the Declaration must include concrete measures to address injustices, combat prejudice and eliminate all forms of violence, racism and discrimination, including systemic racism and discrimination, against [[[[Indigenous]]]] peoples and [[[[Indigenous]]]] elders, youth, children, women, men, persons with disabilities and gender-diverse persons and two-spirit persons;
Whereas all doctrines, policies and practices based on or advocating the superiority of peoples or individuals on the basis of national origin or racial, religious, ethnic or cultural differences, including the doctrines of discovery and terra nullius, are racist, scientifically false, legally invalid, morally condemnable and socially unjust;
Whereas the Government of [[[[Canada]]]] rejects all forms of [[[[colonial]]]]ism and is committed to advancing relations with [[[[Indigenous]]]] peoples that are based on good faith and on the principles of justice, democracy, equality, non-discrimination, good governance and respect for human rights;
Whereas the Declaration emphasizes the urgent need to respect and promote the inherent rights of [[[[Indigenous]]]] peoples of the world which derive from their political, economic and social structures and from their cultures, spiritual traditions, histories, philosophies and legal systems, especially their rights to their lands, territories and [[[[resources]]]];
Whereas the Government of [[[[Canada]]]] recognizes that all relations with [[[[Indigenous]]]] peoples must be based on the recognition and implementation of the inherent right to self-determination, including the right of self-government;
Whereas the Government of [[[[Canada]]]] is committed to taking effective measures — including legislative, policy and administrative measures — at the national and international level, in consultation and cooperation with [[[[Indigenous]]]] peoples, to achieve the objectives of the Declaration;
Whereas the Government of [[[[Canada]]]] is committed to exploring, in consultation and cooperation with [[[[Indigenous]]]] peoples, measures related to monitoring, oversight, recourse or remedy or other accountability measures that will contribute to the achievement of those objectives;
Whereas the implementation of the Declaration can contribute to supporting sustainable development and responding to growing concerns relating to climate change and its impacts on [[[[Indigenous]]]] peoples;
Whereas the Government of [[[[Canada]]]] acknowledges that provincial, territorial and municipal governments each have the ability to establish their own approaches to contributing to the implementation of the Declaration by taking various measures that fall within their authority;
Whereas the Government of [[[[Canada]]]] welcomes opportunities to work cooperatively with those governments, [[[[Indigenous]]]] peoples and other sectors of society towards achieving the objectives of the Declaration;
Whereas the Declaration is affirmed as a source for the interpretation of Canadian law;
Whereas the protection of [[[[Aboriginal]]]] and treaty rights — recognized and affirmed by section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 — is an underlying principle and value of the Constitution of [[[[Canada]]]], and Canadian courts have stated that such rights are not frozen and are capable of evolution and growth;
Whereas there is an urgent need to respect and promote the rights of [[[[Indigenous]]]] peoples affirmed in treaties, [[[[agreement]]]]s and other constructive arrangements, and those treaties, [[[[agreement]]]]s and arrangements can contribute to the implementation of the Declaration;
Whereas respect for human rights, the rule of law and democracy are underlying principles of the Constitution of [[[[Canada]]]] which are interrelated, interdependent and mutually reinforcing and are also recognized in international law;
And whereas measures to implement the Declaration in [[[[Canada]]]] must take into account the diversity of [[[[Indigenous]]]] peoples and, in particular, the diversity of the identities, cultures, languages, customs, practices, rights and legal traditions of First Nations, Inuit and the Métis and of their institutions and governance structures, their relationships to the land and [[[[Indigenous]]]] knowledge;
Now, therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of [[[[Canada]]]], enacts as follows:

Affirming also that all peoples contribute to the diversity and richness of civilizations and cultures, which constitute the common heritage of humankind,
Affirming further that all doctrines, policies and practices based on or advocating superiority of peoples or individuals on the basis of national origin or racial, religious, ethnic or cultural differences are racist, scientifically false, legally invalid, morally condemnable and socially unjust,
Reaffirming that indigenous peoples, in the exercise of their rights, should be free from discrimination of any kind,
Concerned that indigenous peoples have suffered from historic injustices as a result of, inter alia, their colonization and dispossession of their lands, territories and [[[[resources]]]], thus preventing them from exercising, in particular, their right to development in accordance with their own needs and interests,
Recognizing the urgent need to respect and promote the inherent rights of indigenous peoples which derive from their political, economic and social structures and from their cultures, spiritual traditions, histories and philosophies, especially their rights to their lands, territories and [[[[resources]]]],
Recognizing also the urgent need to respect and promote the rights of indigenous peoples affirmed in treaties, [[[[agreement]]]]s and other constructive arrangements with States,
Welcoming the fact that indigenous peoples are organizing themselves for political, economic, social and cultural enhancement and in order to bring to an end all forms of discrimination and oppression wherever they occur,
Convinced that control by indigenous peoples over developments affecting them and their lands, territories and [[[[resources]]]] will enable them to maintain and strengthen their institutions, cultures and traditions, and to promote their development in accordance with their aspirations and needs,
Recognizing that respect for indigenous knowledge, cultures and traditional practices contributes to sustainable and equitable development and proper management of the environment,
Emphasizing the contribution of the demilitarization of the lands and territories of indigenous peoples to peace, economic and social progress and development, understanding and friendly relations among nations and peoples of the world,
Recognizing in particular the right of indigenous families and communities to retain shared responsibility for the upbringing, training, education and well-being of their children, consistent with the rights of the child,
Considering that the rights affirmed in treaties, [[[[agreement]]]]s and other constructive arrangements between States and indigenous peoples are, in some situations, matters of international concern, interest, responsibility and character,
Considering also that treaties, [[[[agreement]]]]s and other constructive arrangements, and the relationship they represent, are the basis for a strengthened partnership between indigenous peoples and States,
Acknowledging that the Charter of the United Nations, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural RightsFootnote2 and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,Footnote2 as well as the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action,Footnote3 affirm the fundamental importance of the right to self-determination of all peoples, by virtue of which they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development,
Return to footnote2See resolution 2200 A (XXI), annex.
Return to footnote3A/CONF.157/24 (Part I), chap. III.
Bearing in mind that nothing in this Declaration may be used to deny any peoples their right to self-determination, exercised in conformity with international law,
Convinced that the recognition of the rights of indigenous peoples in this Declaration will enhance harmonious and cooperative relations between the State and indigenous peoples, based on principles of justice, democracy, respect for human rights, non-discrimination and good faith,
Encouraging States to comply with and effectively implement all their obligations as they apply to indigenous peoples under international instruments, in particular those related to human rights, in consultation and cooperation with the peoples concerned,
Emphasizing that the United Nations has an important and continuing role to play in promoting and protecting the rights of indigenous peoples,

Recognizing and reaffirming that indigenous individuals are entitled without discrimination to all human rights recognized in international law, and that indigenous peoples possess collective rights which are indispensable for their existence, well-being and integral development as peoples,
Recognizing that the situation of indigenous peoples varies from region to region and from country to country and that the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical and cultural backgrounds should be taken into consideration,
Solemnly proclaims the following United Nations Declaration on the Rights of [[[[Indigenous]]]] Peoples as a standard of achievement to be pursued in a spirit of partnership and mutual respect:
