## Introduction
### In reviewing the health of homeless persons in Canadian cities,
Hwang (2001) estimates that the representation of [[Aboriginal]]
peoples in urban homeless populations is approximately 10 times
that of their relative proportion of the general populations of urban
centres. Research on homelessness experienced by [[Aboriginal]] peoples
is slowly increasing, but literature addressing the intersections of
identities (e.g., [[Aboriginal]] women) that builds on a strengths-based
model appears to be scarce. Homelessness does not occur in a
vacuum (Jahiel 1992); creating effective solutions means moving far
beyond narrow, deficit-based stereotypical constructions that paint
homelessness as resulting from individual choices and personal characteristics (e.g., drug use, mental illness, unemployment) and effectively ignore underlying structural issues. For [[Aboriginal]] peoples,
this means constructing an understanding of, and response to, the
needs of those experiencing homelessness and marginal housing that
acknowledges and resists the effects of colonization. We propose an
[[Aboriginal]] approach to conceptualizing and advancing the health
and well-being of [[Aboriginal]] women experiencing marginal housing
or homelessness. This approach would be centred on the vision,
voices, strengths and agency of [[Aboriginal]] women in determining
their health and well-being and would honour their roles and contributions as helpers, not helpless.
Coming Together: Homeless Women, Housing and Social
Support was a community- and arts-based, participatory action
research project that explored how ciswomen build support networks with each other when experiencing homelessness or marginal
housing. This chapter focuses specifically on the findings relating to
the [[Aboriginal]] women who participated in the project. The project
data were initially collected, coded and analyzed using a grounded
theory approach (Charmaz 2006). Later in the research process,
the research team focused on the [[Aboriginal]] sub-sample, drawing
from [[Indigenous]] methodology (Smith 1999) in order to more fully
understand the experiences of [[Aboriginal]] women in the context of
an [[Aboriginal]] worldview. (While the research team would see this
process as the second phase of the data analysis, this can be considered a secondary data analysis to some others.)
### The findings from the subset of [[Aboriginal]] women participants
revealed the kinds of marginalization and violence that they faced
on the streets while attempting to access or maintain housing. At the
same time, they were actively helping each other by offering social
support, sharing stories and [[resources]], accepting each other, promoting safety and volunteering. Moreover, these women offered significant insight into what was needed to improve their situations and the
services they accessed and received. This chapter will focus on the
recommendations for service providers and policy-makers offered by
the participants. The results challenge health and social service providers, policy-makers, educators and researchers to revise discourses
of housing and homelessness, to resist [[colonial]] history and practices
and to instead honour the strength and agency of [[Aboriginal]] women.
## Context of the Research
### [[Aboriginal]] Health and Well-Being in [[Canada]]
Trying to capture a snapshot of the health and well-being of
[[Aboriginal]] peoples generally is quite difficult (Health Council of
[[Canada]] 2005), and that of [[Aboriginal]] women experiencing homelessness even more so. Indeed, the landscape of [[Aboriginal]] health
statistics is not easily navigated. For example, census data gathered
by Statistics [[Canada]] is impacted by incomplete enumeration or nonparticipation of several First Nations (Anderson et al. 2006). Health
data collected through provincial and territorial health systems do
not necessarily or consistently utilize markers for [[Aboriginal]] identity. Even where ethno-racial identification markers are included,
[[Aboriginal]] peoples accessing health services may elect not to identify for fear of racism. [[Aboriginal]] health statistics may be gathered
from one specific subpopulation, for example, First Nations (status
or non-status [[Indian]]s), and yet be generalized to [[Aboriginal]] peoples
as a whole. Indeed, the majority of available information regarding
[[Aboriginal]] peoples is drawn from data collected from the status
[[Indian]] population (cihi 2004, as cited in Health Council of [[Canada]]
2005). As such, [[Aboriginal]] health data should be appreciated, with
clear acknowledgement of all of its complications and challenges, for
what it offers in helping to further our understanding.
There is a need for a general statement regarding the use of
statistics (and other research data) relating to [[Aboriginal]] peoples, not
only in terms of data collection (methods, sampling, generalizability,
etc.), but in the responsibility to avoid inadvertently reinforcing stereotypes and systemic racism through the application of statistics.
While this may seem like an obvious statement to some, the deeply
painful history of both research and social policy directed towards
[[Aboriginal]] peoples underlines the responsibility of researchers,
educators, policy-makers, health professionals and community and
social workers to gather, share and apply statistics in ways that disrupt stereotypical, one-dimensional ideas about [[Aboriginal]] peoples
and instead advance the health, well-being and self-determination
of [[Aboriginal]] communities. One means of responsibly utilizing statistics and other data derived from research is to ensure adequate
discussion of the historical and ongoing [[colonial]] context faced by
[[Aboriginal]] peoples. Another is to ensure the data is framed within
the perspectives and voices of [[Aboriginal]] peoples. The purpose of
including this statement here is to contextualize the challenges of
engaging in and contributing to discussions of [[Aboriginal]] peoples’
health and to stress the importance of doing so in ways that clearly
identify limitations and actively move towards disrupting rather than
reinforcing negative discourses of [[Aboriginal]] peoples. In the section that follows, we review available information on the health and
well-being of [[Aboriginal]] women, as well as examining the impacts
of historical and contemporary [[colonial]]ism on [[Aboriginal]] women.
[[Aboriginal]] Women: Looking at Our Past, in the Present, for the Future
### To look at our past, in the present, for the future is a traditional teaching shared across many nations. In the case of [[Aboriginal]] women
experiencing homelessness and marginal housing, this means looking at the history of colonization and its effects within the contemporary context, with an eye towards positively transforming their
health and well-being and the social conditions they face.
The past. The effects of colonization on the lives of [[Aboriginal]]
peoples are undeniable even though the [[colonial]] history of [[Canada]]
receives limited attention in our public schools and public discourse
(Kempf 2006). The intersectional effect of gender and racialization
has amplified the impact of colonization on [[Aboriginal]] women.
Attacking the roles of [[Aboriginal]] women was, in fact, a key strategy in destabilizing First Nations and establishing [[colonial]] control
(Anderson 2004; Lawrence and Anderson 2005; Walters and Simoni
2002). Mohanram (1999) describes the fundamental role of women
in building and maintaining a nation, in that women quite literally
reproduce the nation through childbirth. She further highlights the
patriarchal discourses of colonization that have and continue to
portray women as existing without agency. The very idea of women
without agency directly contravenes the status, roles and responsibilities of [[Aboriginal]] women on Turtle Island (North America) prior
to European contact. Within the tremendous diversity of [[Aboriginal]]
nations and their traditions across Turtle Island, [[Aboriginal]] women
were understood as powerful and sacred; they held multiple and
varying roles as helpers, healers, teachers, leaders, warriors, knowledge keepers and lifegivers (Walters and Simoni 2002). In matriarchal
societies, [[Aboriginal]] women carried responsibilities for or control
over property and leadership, for example, within the Haudenosanee
Nations in which women held all property rights, and Clan Mothers
were charged with selecting and deposing of leaders.
### The [[colonial]] project of European settlers, aided by the work of
[[Christian]] missionaries, undertook to ‘civilize’ [[Aboriginal]] peoples
by upending traditional governance structures and cultural values
and practices and by imposing and enforcing European values and
norms, including patriarchy and the consequent subordination of
women (Bourassa, McKay-McNabb and Hampton 2005; Lawrence
and Anderson 2005). These efforts were ultimately institutionalized
in the [[Indian]] Act of 1876, legislation that resulted in multiple human
rights violations, including the political exclusion of women. The
Act usurped the role of [[Aboriginal]] women in selecting and deposing
leaders (i.e., the role of Clan Mothers) and prevented them from holding leadership positions themselves. The legislation instead inserted
band chief and council structures in which only men were eligible
for election and in which women held no right to vote (Blair 2005).
### The [[Indian]] Act further removed the real property rights of [[Aboriginal]]
women and regulated their status such that women who married
non-[[Aboriginal]] men (or non-status [[Aboriginal]] men) would lose
their status, as would their children. This stood in contradiction to
the treatment of status [[Aboriginal]] men who, upon marrying non[[Aboriginal]] women, conferred their status on their wife and, subsequently, their children.
### In response to activism and legal action by [[Aboriginal]] women,
the federal government passed Bill C-31 in 1985, rescinding the
‘enfranchisement’ provisions of the [[Indian]] Act and reinstating
those who had lost their status. Bill C-31 was meant to ensure the
conformity of the [[Indian]] Act with the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms, specifically section 15—the equality rights section. Using
a ‘gender neutral’ approach, Bill C-31 removed the purely patrilineal
eligibility for status, but it did not also provide [[Aboriginal]] women
with the right to confer status onto their spouses and children.
### Instead, it situated status men in a position similar to that of status
women, such that children of status women or men who married
non-status or non-[[Aboriginal]] individuals could no longer confer
their status on their own children if they too married a non-status or
non-[[Aboriginal]] partner. The irony of Bill C-31, which was touted as a
vehicle to restore gender equity for [[Aboriginal]] women and increase
the number of people who qualify for [[Indian]] status, is that it actually
works to speed the extinction of status [[Indian]]s—since hundreds of
thousands of descendants of today’s status [[Indian]]s will be excluded
from status rights over the coming decades. This policy action has
arguably significantly benefited the federal government by decreasing the status [[Indian]] population, for whom the government has a
fiduciary duty to provide, thereby reducing associated obligations
and costs (Daniels 1998).
### The removal of property rights through the [[Indian]] Act continues to significantly impact [[Aboriginal]] women today. Provincial
matrimonial real property laws do not apply to [[Aboriginal]] women
living on reserve, as reserve land is a matter of federal jurisdiction
and the use of reserve lands, including housing, is controlled directly
by band councils (Blair 2005). This is especially problematic for
women experiencing violence, which Blair (2005) has estimated to be
approximately one in three among [[Aboriginal]] women. The violence
faced by [[Aboriginal]] women is compounded by chronic and severe
on-reserve housing shortages, such that the lack of matrimonial real
property rights means that [[Aboriginal]] women experiencing violence
may be forced to choose between fleeing at the cost of their housing or continuing to live in violence in order to maintain housing
(Blair 2005). Violence is a well-documented force in the migration
of [[Aboriginal]] women to urban centres (nafc 2012; rcap 1996). The
federal government has been engaged in consultation around and the
development of multiple (failed) bills for more than thirteen years,
including Bill S-2. However, the legacy of this legal limbo and the
continued strain of housing shortages will not simply disappear with
one new piece of legislation.
### The denigration of [[Aboriginal]] women was a central goal in
the [[colonial]] project of European settlement (Walters and Simoni
2002), achieved through multiple means, including legislated and
systemic oppression, social and economic exclusion, physical and
sexual violence and the rupture and erosion of the role of [[Aboriginal]]
women in having and caring for their children. This has included
forced sterilization of [[Aboriginal]] women in both [[Canada]] and the
United States (the division of which was only created through a
[[colonial]] imposed border). In the 1970s, approximately 40 percent of
[[Aboriginal]] women of childbearing age in the United States experienced non-consensual sterilization administered by the federally run
[[Indian]] Health Services (Walters and Simoni 2002). This practice of
eugenics also occurred here in [[Canada]], although to a lesser degree
and primarily in Alberta and [[British]] [[Columbia]] (Grekul, Krahn
and Odynak 2004). More than 2,800 [[Aboriginal]] women underwent
forced sterilization in Alberta alone between 1928 and 1972 (Truth
Commission into Genocide in [[Canada]] 2001). Testimony provided to
the Truth Commission into Genocide in [[Canada]] (2001), indicated that
sterilization of [[Aboriginal]] women was in fact a standard practice in
some places (i.e., provincial training schools). Additional testimonial
evidence provided to the Commission suggests that the Department
of [[Indian]] Affairs provided a financial reward to physicians for each
[[Aboriginal]] woman sterilized, in particularly “if they weren’t churchgoers” (Truth Commission 2001: 13).
### In addition to eugenics, the goals of cultural annihilation were
enacted by the mass removal of [[Aboriginal]] children from their
families, homes and communities, first in the era of residential
schools and then through the assertion of child welfare authority
in the lives of [[Aboriginal]] families, which saw thousands of children
taken into foster care or placed in cross-cultural adoption. While
some may wish to relegate residential schooling or invasive child
welfare practices to the distant past, the last residential school in
[[Canada]] closed in 1996, and recent data from the National Household
Survey suggests that [[Aboriginal]] children presently constitute nearly
half of the estimated 30,000 children in care in [[Canada]] (Woods and
Kirkey 2013), despite the fact that [[Aboriginal]] peoples are thought to
compose less than 5 percent of the Canadian population (Statistics
[[Canada]] 2011). Residential schooling and child welfare involvement
have been associated directly with adverse health outcomes, such as,
increased risk and rates of hiv and hepatitis C (Pearce et al. 2008) as
well as social determinants of poorer health, including homelessness
(Baskin 2007; Sinclair 2009).
### Colonization has had an undeniably devastating, intergenerational and collective impact on [[Aboriginal]] peoples, tearing at the
fabric of [[Aboriginal]] ways of knowing and being, including substantive damage to roles of and respect accorded to [[Aboriginal]] women
prior to contact and to family and community cohesion. In the context
of decolonizing communities and improving [[Aboriginal]] health and
well-being as a whole, the health and well-being, wisdom and vision
of [[Aboriginal]] women is integral. An often cited Cheyenne saying
states that “A Nation is not defeated, until the hearts of its women
are on the ground”, so that by caring for our women, honouring our
women, raising their voices and raising their hearts, we are also caring for, honouring and renewing our nations.
The present. Subsequent to colonization, [[Aboriginal]] women face
severe marginalization in Canadian society. [[Aboriginal]] women are
more likely than their non-[[Aboriginal]] counterparts to experience
poverty, under- or unemployment, under housing, homelessness
or incarceration (Dion Stout, Kipling and Stout 2001; nwac, 2007a).
They are also more likely than non-[[Aboriginal]] women to have lower
levels of educational achievement and to live with poorer community
infrastructure and [[resources]] as a result of the persistent economic
marginalization of [[Aboriginal]] peoples in [[Canada]] (Adelson 2005;
non-[[Aboriginal]] women to die as a result of violence and eight times
more likely to die by spousal homicide (caefs n.d.). The violence
levelled at [[Aboriginal]] girls and women is painfully captured in the
epidemic of missing and murdered [[Aboriginal]] women in [[Canada]],
an issue that has recently been identified as a subject of inquiry by
the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination
Against Women (Talaga 2012). While the [[Native]] Women’s Association
of [[Canada]] (nwac 2010) has verified nearly 600 cases of missing and
murdered [[Aboriginal]] women, other activists suggest that the actual
number may be much higher (Kraus 2011; Talaga 2012).
[[Aboriginal]] women experience alarming disparities in health,
with higher rates of heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, multiple
forms of cancer (including cervical and gallbladder), hiv/aids, mental illness, substance abuse and suicide (Dion Stout, Kipling and
Stout 2001; Gatali and Archibald 2003; nwac 2007b). They not only
experience a shorter life expectancy and higher infant mortality
rate than non-[[Aboriginal]] women (Statistics [[Canada]] 2006; Smylie,
Fell and Ohlsson 2010) but also higher rates of chronic disease than
[[Aboriginal]] men (Bourassa, McKay-McNabb and Hampton 2005).
### This disproportionate burden of ill-health reflects the inequities
[[Aboriginal]] women face in foundational determinants of health,
including housing, income, [[food]] security, education, violence and
environmental degradation (nafc 2012).
### While recent census data estimates 54 percent of the overall
[[Aboriginal]] population now resides in urban centres (Statistics
[[Canada]] 2008), fully 78 percent of [[Aboriginal]] women live off-reserve
(Statistics [[Canada]] 2006). Among [[Aboriginal]] women living off reserve,
52 percent have been diagnosed with a chronic health condition by
a health professional (Vancouver Women’s Health Collective 2006).
Homelessness and marginal housing are in no way limited to urban
contexts; however, the Coming Together Project was conducted in
an urban centre ([[Toronto]]) and reflects the types of experiences and
services accessed by [[Aboriginal]] women in a large, metropolitan
city. As such, we focus our discussion and recommendations within
the realm of urban housing and homelessness, while recognizing
that homelessness and marginal housing are issues that abide by
no geographical bounds. In fact, there is a need, beyond the scope
of this chapter, to ensure more attention to issues of homelessness
and marginal housing in rural, remote and Northern environments
(see, for example, Qulliit Nunavut Status of Women Council 2007;
Yukon Status of Women Council 2007).
Urban [[Aboriginal]] peoples earn substantially less than the
median income of their non-urban counterparts and face higher rates
of homelessness, tuberculosis, diabetes, hiv/aids, substance abuse and
suicide than their non-[[Aboriginal]] peers (Benoit et al. 2003). Urban
[[Aboriginal]] women are more likely than non-[[Aboriginal]] women to
be lone mothers and to face difficulty in providing basic necessities
for their children, including [[food]], clothing and housing (uatf 2007).
Homelessness statistics for the city of [[Toronto]] indicate that while
[[Aboriginal]] peoples are estimated to compose less than 1 percent of
the city’s entire population, they account for approximately 15 percent of the homeless population but fully 26 percent of ‘rough sleepers’, meaning those who sleep outside (Novac et al. 2006; Khandor
and Mason 2007).
Methods
Description of the Project
The research findings presented herein are part of a larger, multimethod community-based research project entitled Coming Together:
Homeless Women, Housing and Social Support, which explored how
ciswomen1 and transwomen with experiences of homelessness build
support networks with each other in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]]. Adhering to
the community-based research approach (e.g., Flicker and Savan 2006;
Israel et al. 1998), the Coming Together Project was a collaborative
effort between a university and two community agencies serving
people who are homeless.
These findings were derived from a secondary analysis of the
data, particularly focusing on the subset of the data comprising of
[[Aboriginal]] ciswomen and transwomen participants, whose experiences were contrasted to that of the non-[[Aboriginal]] participants.
Unlike what is typically seen when the term secondary data analysis
is used, which typically involves an analysis of a large data set previously collected by a governmental body (e.g., Statistics [[Canada]]
survey data sets, health utilization data from a provincial/territorial
registries, etc.) or other researchers, this process involved a second
phase analysis of our own data (from interviews and arts-based focus

66 HOMELESSNESS & HEALTH IN CANADIAN POPULATIONS
groups) with the intention of generating a deeper understanding of
the experiences of [[Aboriginal]] participants through the application
of a more ‘Indigenized’ approach to data analysis.
The analysis drew upon both a constructivist grounded theory
approach (Charmaz 2006), where data collection and analysis are
conducted hand-in-hand in a cyclical manner involving multiple
reiteration of coding strategies, and upon [[Aboriginal]]/[[Indigenous]]
knowledge and principles regarding the gathering and care of
knowledge (research). Maori scholar Linda Tuhiwai Smith (1999) sets
out several projects for [[Indigenous]] research, including ‘reframing’,
which seeks to transform how social issues of [[Indigenous]] peoples
are discussed and addressed. In the context of this project, reframing
required continuous attention to the historical context of the lives and
circumstances of the participants with an eye to what could be done
now to disrupt the chronic, [[colonial]] marginalization of [[Aboriginal]]
women and create change for our future.
The project’s advisory board was comprised of seven ciswomen
and transwomen who had experienced homelessness, including
two [[Aboriginal]] members. During the project implementation and follow-up, two [[Aboriginal]] PhD students (Billie Allan and Rose Cameron)
also became research assistants, helping with data collection, transcription, data management, data analysis and dissemination. The analysis
presented herein was led by one of the [[Aboriginal]] researchers involved
in the project (Billie) in consultation with the rest of the team, including
the advisory board. She also integrated [[Indigenous]] research methodology (Smith 1999) during the analysis process so that we can understand
and describe the experiences of [[Aboriginal]] women more fully.
As is often the case with community-based participatory
research, the ethics approval process involved multiple steps to allow
for flexibility in research design to reflect participants’ opinions and
increase the trustworthiness of research findings. In Phase I, in-depth
face-to-face semi-structured interviews for both service providers
and researchers as key informants (n = 13) and service users (women
and transwomen who were homeless; n = 20) were conducted at
either the participant’s location or at a mutually designated location.
For service user participants, each interview participant received a
$25 honorarium and two transit tokens as a token of appreciation and
partially to compensate for their time and contribution.
Of the 20 ciswomen and transwomen with experiences of
homelessness interviewed, 11 were between the ages of 40 and 59

Helpers, Not Helpless 67
and nine were between 25 and 39 years old. Six identified as transwomen and 14 identified as women (ciswomen, non-transwomen).
Nine of the ciswomen and transwomen with experiences of homelessness interviewed identified as [[Aboriginal]] or Metis, seven as white
or of European descent and four identified as people of colour. At
the time of their interviews, five ciswomen/transwomen had been
homeless or marginally housed for over 10 years, two had been
homeless or marginally housed between five and 10 years, six had
been in similar situations between one and five years and seven had
been without stable housing for up to a year. The living situations of
the ciswomen and transwomen at the time of the study varied. Two
ciswomen/transwomen were living on the street, two were living in
subsidized housing, four were living in private housing, five were
staying with relatives or friends and seven were accessing shelter
or hostel services. Of 13 service providers interviewed, five service
providers worked mostly with [[Aboriginal]] women, while one worked
specifically with transwomen (including [[Aboriginal]] transwomen),
and the rest worked with a range of ciswomen/transwomen who are
marginally housed or homeless. While the experiences and insights
of the service providers were a valuable part of our project, giving us
a deeper understanding of the issues, due to space limitations, in this
chapter we have chosen to focus mainly on the voices of ciswomen
and transwomen who were actively experiencing homelessness or
marginal housing themselves.
Based on the findings from Phase I, Phase II of the project was
designed to be more participatory, action oriented and arts based. To
ensure that this project was based on participatory, anti-oppressive
and empowerment approaches (Gutiérrez and Lewis 1999; Ristock
and Pennel 1996; Sakamoto and Pitner 2005), an advisory board
was created consisting of women and transwomen who used their
own experiences of being homeless and/or marginally housed to
critically reflect on the information previously collected through
interviews. These ciswomen/transwomen were recruited from the
communities where the initial interviews had been conducted. Many
of the members were asked to participate because of their reputations for supporting other homeless women. Out of seven advisory
board members, three were transwomen, two were [[Aboriginal]] (one
identified as a transwoman) and two were ciswomen or transwomen
of colour. Advisory board members acted as consultants and peer
researchers throughout the rest of the research process, participating

68 HOMELESSNESS & HEALTH IN CANADIAN POPULATIONS
in the arts-making sessions, brainstorming the results with the rest
of the team and helping the team make key decisions in analysis and
dissemination strategies.
In Phase II, in order to examine and expand the earlier findings and generate more voices from ciswomen and transwomen
who have experienced homelessness, the research team proposed
to conduct arts-based group activities. Art has the power to bring
people together in ways that verbal interaction alone may not be
able. Further, the process of making art can allow for the creation
of alternative and inclusive knowledge. To design and facilitate the
process, a community artist, Natalie Wood, who had experience with
art education, community organizing and working with ciswomen
and transwomen who have experienced homelessness and poverty
was hired to be as part of the research team.
The advisory board first met to review the project material
and develop the key themes through discussion and brainstorming.
In collaboration with the artist (Natalie), the advisory board members chose method of ‘staged photography’2 for the next phase of
data collection. The artistic form was based on Natalie’s experience
teaching art with homeless and marginally housed women and her
commitment to applying collaborative methodology and using a
form of artistic expression in which all could participate. We also set
Figure 3-1. Members of the advisory board and research team

Helpers, Not Helpless 69
a two-to-three-hour time limit for the discussion and distillation of
ideas and experiences into visual form, because it was unlikely that
exactly the same group of ciswomen and transwomen would return
to the drop-in centres on a subsequent date had more than one session been required to complete the activity. The advisory board members were given a ‘crash course’ on the artistic form, collaborative
methodology and how to transform the language of experience into
visual metaphors that were unique and not stereotypical. The goal
of this approach was to give voice to those individuals whose voices
have been silenced, marginalized and socially isolated—in this case,
ciswomen and transwomen who are homeless or marginally housed.
The advisory board and research team travelled to four drop-in
centres across [[Toronto]] to engage groups of ciswomen/transwomen
in the art-making sessions (overall n = 501). Through painting,
costumes, theatre and photography, groups of ciswomen and transwomen who have experienced homelessness created scenes depicting their own visions and stories of inclusion, friendships and safe
spaces. The preliminary findings were then followed by subsequent
consultations with advisory board members and feedback sessions
with ciswomen and transwomen at four drop-in sites. In addition
to printing four posters depicting these four stories, a community
research report was published to more fully capture the process
and outcomes of research (Sakamoto et al. 2007). Dissemination of
the research results included public exhibits of photos, distribution
of posters and research reports, academic and community presentations and writing of journal articles (Sakamoto et al. 2009), followed
by a larger synthesis report, joint exhibit and new website with
seven other community-based, arts-informed research projects on
homelessness in [[Toronto]], entitled Homelessness: Solutions from
Lived Experiences through Arts-Informed Research3
 (Sakamoto et al.
2008). For further description of the methodology, please refer to the
project report, Coming Together: Homeless Women, Housing and Social
Support—With a special focus on the experiences of [[Aboriginal]] women and
transwomen (Sakamoto et al. 2010).
An ‘Indigenized’ Approach to Grounded Theory Data Analysis
Building upon the grounded theory methodology employed in the
broader research project, the analysis of the [[Aboriginal]] women’s subset of data employed a methodology that drew upon both grounded
theory and [[Indigenous]] knowledge practices regarding the gathering

70 HOMELESSNESS & HEALTH IN CANADIAN POPULATIONS
and care of knowledge (research). The challenge of bridging between
these two ways of knowing and handling knowledge is not easy,
and the limitations of Western approaches to organizing data in
being able to generate a meaningful understanding of [[Indigenous]]
experiences have been increasingly discussed by other [[Indigenous]]
researchers (Absolon and Willett 2004; Kovach 2009; Lavallée 2009).
Moreover, the considerable abuse, harm, loss and exploitation
historically endured by [[Indigenous]] peoples in the name of scholarly research means that any kind of research method used with
[[Indigenous]] peoples requires the utmost critical consciousness and
attention to issues of power, domination and marginalization. As
an [[Indigenous]] researcher [the first author of this article, Billie], this
issue is particularly personal; I entered the process with a visceral
understanding of all that has been stolen, misrepresented and used
to create and enforce [[colonial]] policies and practices on our peoples
(Absolon 2011; Smith 1999). Therefore, the process of engaging in
data analysis involved a constant negotiation between the ideas of
grounded theory, and the Western knowledge system from which it
evolves, and [[Indigenous]] ways of conceptualizing and understanding
all of existence. The process required a decolonizing lens in order
that we all be cognizant of how both the process and the outcome of
the research impacted the lives of the women: Did it further reinforce
their marginalization and dehumanization or did it help to bring
forward their voices, stories and wisdom? Was the analysis ignoring
or embodying the values of [[Indigenous]] ways of knowing and caring
for the stories the women had gifted us with?
The approach to coding and the subsequent themes and stories
that emerged and are shared here reflect Smith’s (1999) project of
reframing, which acknowledges the power of framing not only in
how an issue is understood, but whether and how it is responded to:
The framing of an issue is about making decisions about its
parameters, about what is in the foreground, what is in the
background, and what shadings or complexities exist within
the frame. The project of reframing is related to defining the
problem or issue and determining how best to solve that problem. (153)
The use of grounded theory coding processes to stay close to
the knowledge provided by each participant, positioned within an

Helpers, Not Helpless 71
[[Indigenous]] worldview that attends to the historical and contemporary contexts of [[Aboriginal]] women and to the project of reframing,
follows what [[Cree]] scholar Margaret Kovach (2009) has referred to as
a ‘modified grounded theory’ in which the researcher must attend
to both the ‘berry’ (each small piece of knowledge) and the ‘bush’
(the context and relations in which each ‘berry’ exists). This ‘grounding’ of analysis in an [[Indigenous]] worldview aims to resist the fragmentation of [[Indigenous]] experience that may otherwise be caused
by a grounded theory approach to data analysis as highlighted by
[[Algonquin]]/[[Cree]]/Metis scholar Lynn Lavallée (2009).
Results: Voices and Vision, Using Lived Experience to Create
Change
The [[Aboriginal]] women participating in the project (both in the interviews and arts-making sessions) offered many recommendations to
improve service provision based on their lived experiences, insight
and the wisdom they carry inside of themselves—this wisdom could
also then be understood as their embodied knowledge. Honouring the
embodied knowledge of participants ruptures the discourse of who
is understood to hold knowledge in the interactions between those
accessing and and those providing services addressing the health
and well-being of [[Aboriginal]] women experiencing homelessness.
It also challenges what kind of knowledge is understood as valid.
Centring the embodied knowledge of [[Aboriginal]] women honours
their strengths, voices and visions, as well as their struggles, challenges and needs. It disrupts practices, intentional or unintentional,
that position [[Aboriginal]] women as lacking understanding, insight
or expertise of their very own lived experiences.
The recommendations offered by participants ranged from
micro to macro practices, such as improving communication between
and within agencies, increased outreach services, the development of services for women who are homeless with disabilities
and efforts to remove structural barriers to service for women
who are actively using drugs and alcohol. Themes within this part
of the data included understanding/compassion, communication
and transforming services. We explore these themes below, drawing linkages and discussing the implications for those involved in
policy-making, programming (design, delivery and evaluation) and
frontline services.

Understanding and Compassion
Participants discussed the challenges of navigating systems of service
and care and spoke directly to the need for deepened understanding
and compassion on the part of staff at receiving agencies or services.
We shouldn’t be treated like criminals or like we’ve done something bad
and need to be punished. This humiliation is re-victimizing—we’ve
already left abusive situations and now we get treated like this in the
shelter . . . . When I arrived at the shelter I was told by one of the intake
workers not to make friends with the other women. This goes to show
how that worker regards the women staying in the shelter. And at the
shelter, compassion is taking a second seat. It feels that the rules are
more important to the shelter than each person as an individual.
– Dorene,4 Ojibwe-European woman, 40–59 years old,
residing in a shelter, following approximately
one year of marginal housing
Don’t blame it on you ’cause I find I get a lot of that ‘It’s your fault
you’re homeless’, so more open-mindedness and understanding of where
that person’s coming from.
– Shelley, Ojibwe woman, 25–39 years old,
residing in a shelter for the past five months
after having lived on the streets for 1.5 years
These recommendations may seem small or even simple in
terms of what is needed to create change. However, in light of the
historical and contemporary conditions experienced by [[Aboriginal]]
women previously discussed in this chapter, it is even more apparent why experiences of uncompassionate or even humiliating care
could compound personal and societal experiences of colonization
and racism. On the other hand, caring, genuine and accepting care
can constitute a major element of accessibility of services.
Improved Communication
Communication between agencies, and between staff within agencies, was a need clearly identified by the women. Increased communication was viewed as an essential piece of respect, and necessary
to avoid humiliation or re-victimization:

Helpers, Not Helpless 73
Share information amongst staff better so that we don’t have to keep
telling our histories of abuse over and over. Women are shuffled around,
not helped. Once you’ve told your story, you shouldn’t have to keep
reliving it. Direct and respectful communication is a key to building
trusting relationships between those seeking and providing services.
– Dorene
Problematic communication can speak to underlying dynamics, as
discussed by a participant in the following passage:
So there is a whole lack of understanding by social service workers who
try to speak a pretty language under the crisis management ideal as
opposed to speaking plain [[English]] and saying this is what I want from
you. Social services are very much about treating people like children.
If you’re good I’ll feed you and if you’re bad you have to go home now—
even though you don’t have a home. As opposed to ‘this is an adult,
and I’m asking you to be respectful in my space’, ‘I have to work here
so you need to be respectful’. That’s what is not happening in social
services. There is an ‘us’ and a ‘them’. And they talk about boundaries.
‘Boundaries’ is another fake social services word. Boundaries are for
people who don’t have the nuts to say ‘no’.
– Kim, Metis woman, 40–59 years old, residing
in subsidized housing with a history of both
homelessness and marginal housing
A focus on increased direct and positive communication could go a
long way towards uprooting and transforming unhealthy or harmful
power dynamics. Uprooting power dynamics is necessary to transforming the accessibility and experiences of health and social services for those who are homeless, where access and quality of these
services is understood as a determinant of health and well-being. For
[[Aboriginal]] women, open examination and transformation of power
dynamics can serve to honour their knowledge and contributions in
the process and contribute towards [[Aboriginal]] self-determination.
Transforming Services
Participants offered concrete recommendations for transforming
services based on their lived experience and embodied knowledge.
These recommendations underline the importance of, as one participant stated, “a system in place to meet each woman’s specific needs.

74 HOMELESSNESS & HEALTH IN CANADIAN POPULATIONS
They need to realize that we are individuals and we have individual
needs”. Moreover, the following recommendations would all serve
to decrease the marginalization of [[Aboriginal]] women (and women
generally) experiencing homelessness. They make visible the interlocking nature of oppression where existing marginalization based
on race, culture, gender and housing status are further compounded
by additional factors.

For example, one participant spoke of the challenges she faced
in navigating homelessness services with a disability. She suggested
that
There should be specific places/facilities for women with disabilities
where women can get extra rest [and not be forced out during the day]
and get special diet requirements met and have counsellors.
– Dorene
Ensuring that services for those experiencing homelessness or marginal housing are not only physically accessible but also appropriate and responsive to the specific needs of women with disabilities
should be considered a basic act of maintaining human rights. While
the context of shelter services in particular tends to be marked by a
lack of [[resources]], high workloads and low staffing, a failure to recognize and respond to the needs of women with disabilities could
be read as a symptom of a system that ignores the individual needs
and context of each woman. Moreover, there is a need to deconstruct
policies that require women to leave shelter services during the daytime, since these policies assume the ability to do so—and to do so
without risk of harm to oneself or one’s health.
Another participant spoke to the challenges and barriers to services faced by women who are actively using substances or alcohol.
She advocated for a revision of policies that exclude women who are
using from accessing services:
These women need agencies even if they are smoking crack. They
should be allowed to smoke crack inside agencies if that is what it takes
to get them in the door ’cause even if they are stoned, at least they’re
sitting there [in an agency] talking. Giving them a place to cry if they
need to and relieve themselves could mean more to them than even
buying them a house.
– Diane, [[Native]]/Black woman, 40–59 years old,
residing on the street for about five years
While allowing service users to smoke crack inside an agency may
situate on the extreme end of a spectrum of options to make services
more accessible to women who are using, the suggestion does highlight some important considerations. First, increasing the accessibility
of services for women who are using should reflect a compassionate

76 HOMELESSNESS & HEALTH IN CANADIAN POPULATIONS
understanding of the reasons they are engaged in use in the first
place. Secondly, it is arguable that women who are using, specifically [[Aboriginal]] women, may be at increased risk of harm in terms
of violence and sexual assault. As such, policy and practice revision
around substance and alcohol use could also increase safety.
Outreach services were a focus for one participant, who emphasized the role of outreach in decreasing isolation and making service
utilization more viable for her:
They should have more outreach support for loners like me. ’Cause a
lot of the time I won’t go searching for something. Either I’m too afraid,
or nervous, so more outreach for women on the streets, and support.
– Shelley
While another participant stressed the importance of having options
in terms of service providers available to her:
Where I go for support depends on how I’m feeling. For example, if
I want a male or a female. Different days, different feelings—different
people. Sometimes only females [service providers] will do. Some days
a male [service provider] will ask me how I’m doing and I’ll say ‘fine’,
meanwhile my life could be falling apart. That’s why it’s important to
have a lot of different people around you who can give you support, so
you can pick and choose.
– Ruth, [[Aboriginal]] woman, 40–59 years old, recently
residing in rented room in private apartment after
having been homeless for approximately three years
One participant shared from her experiences of having both
been homeless and of providing ‘frontline’ services to women experiencing homelessness. She offered several powerful insights into
needed transformation in how we deliver or even imagine services
directed towards those experiencing homelessness:
If you want to do anything to support street people, they have an
incredible amount of grief. I have spent more time with my clients
allowing them a safe place to grieve than anything else because it’s not
safe out there. The only thing you can do in social work is give them
that space, because they are in a chronic state of loss.

Helpers, Not Helpless 77
My advice to agencies is to get out of Dodge. Why are we
pouring money into shelters? I don’t want shelters. I refuse to do
any activism around shelters. People are not dogs. I do not need a
20-year-old kid telling me when I can take a shower, when I can wash
my hair, what clothes I can wear, when to go to bed, and, and, and,
and. This is ludicrous. There’s a whole political agenda to keeping
people poverty ridden and homeless. We pump more and more money
into shelters and we get more and more homeless. Hasn’t somebody
said ‘What the fuck!!!’ That has nothing to do with any of this, this is
about land! There is enough empty land in this city and enough empty
houses to house everybody in it . . . . There are a million creative ways
to solve the problem that poor people already do all the time which is
squat, break in, jump in, sleep on it, bring a friend into it, climb over
the roof of it. Just give people a spot, they’ll build a home, have a barrel
and be perfectly happy. They don’t need you, they don’t need me. We
have been conned that we’re helpless. We’re told we’re psychologically
unhealthy if we’re independent.
– Kim
Kim (not her real name) problematizes both the micro and
macro understandings and responses to homelessness and the needs
of those who are homeless. These passages highlight how current
discourses of homelessness obscure, erase or ignore the agency of
those who are homeless, resulting in services that can inadvertently
imply to service users that they are helpless and reinforce feelings
of grief, isolation and marginalization. In response, then, raising the
voices of those who have or currently are experiencing homelessness
and ensuring their active and meaningful involvement in policy,
program and service development and delivery should transform
both individual experiences and societal discourses of homelessness.
Discussion
Looking Towards the Future
The [[Aboriginal]] women who participated in the Coming Together
project generously shared their voices and vision, clearly demonstrating their agency and wisdom in opposition to the negative stereotypical constructions of homeless [[Aboriginal]] women. They offer
suggestions on how to move forward in a good way. While commonly
housing, income, and service are understood as critical components

78 HOMELESSNESS & HEALTH IN CANADIAN POPULATIONS
of addressing homelessness in [[Canada]], the specific needs, history,
strengths, and experiences of [[Aboriginal]] women need to be taken
into account, considering when [[Aboriginal]] peoples are disproportionately represented in homelessness in general. It is not enough
just to address universal formula of resolving homelessness, but we
need to step further to address particular issues, such as issues of
[[colonial]]ism, violence against [[Aboriginal]] women, and many other
issues that affect [[Aboriginal]] women’s lives differently than non[[Aboriginal]] women’s lives every day. Figure 3-3 (Sakamoto, Chin and
Baskin 2010; Sakamoto et al. 2008) highlights this notion of needing
to meaningfully include specific experiences of different identity/
social membership groups that go through homelessness differently
in order to effectively address homelessness as a whole. Reflecting on
the voices and vision of the [[Aboriginal]] women participants shared in
this chapter, we propose the following implications for those working
within systems associated with homelessness.

accountability’ to address homelessness

Reconstructing Ideas of Help and Helpers
There is a lot to be learned in here for how we think about, undertake,
evaluate and plan the role of helping. Helping in the Western sense
typically constructs the helper as one side of an equation, the powerful, normative, functional side. However, from an [[Aboriginal]] perspective a helper is an honoured role and responsibility. We all carry
roles as helpers, but with different gifts to give. [[Aboriginal]] women,
and particularly those experiencing homelessness, are not typically
recognized for their gifts. They are situated among the lowest of the
low in terms of marginalization in Canadian society. The racialized,
sexualized violence levelled at [[Aboriginal]] women is starkly marked
by the epidemic of missing and murdered women (e.g., nwac 2010). We
need system and service level responses that disrupt insidious societal
stories of [[Aboriginal]] women experiencing homelessness as dependent,
unworthy or helpless. Systems and services should honour the gifts
and roles of these women as helpers, with important wisdom and
experience to offer, in transforming their own safety, well-being and
health and that of their families and communities. Honouring their
voices and visions should occur in the creation, implementation or
evaluation of policies, programs and services aimed at meeting their
needs (including housing, shelter, health and social service systems).
[[Aboriginal]] women who have or are currently experiencing homelessness should be well-represented in service organization boards of
directors, community advisory panels, policy-making bodies, research
teams and frontline service delivery and management.
Decolonizing Systems, Services and Care
Decolonizing the education, practice and research of health and
helping professions requires knowledge of [[Aboriginal]] histories prior
to contact, of the history of colonization and cultural genocide and
of the ongoing and intergenerational effects of colonization on both
[[Aboriginal]] peoples and broader Canadian society today. Ignorance
of the colonization and its effects enables the severe marginalization
of [[Aboriginal]] women, their families, communities and nations to
remain invisible and intact. As such, this should constitute mandatory content in the education and training of service providers and
policy-makers. This education should also be delivered by [[Aboriginal]]
peoples themselves.
In the context of policy development or change, decolonization
efforts would include the involvement of [[Aboriginal]] women with

80 HOMELESSNESS & HEALTH IN CANADIAN POPULATIONS
direct experiences of homelessness, extending well beyond tokenism or one-off consultations, to ensure meaningful input and actual
power to effect change. In the context of program development and
delivery, decolonization would demand that programs are not simply based in Western perspectives; indeed, [[Aboriginal]] approaches to
helping would naturally fit with a decolonizing agenda. Reflecting
notions of interconnectedness, interdependence and reciprocity, an
[[Aboriginal]] approach would recognize all parties as sharing responsibility for health and well-being and each person having something
to offer. In this way, [[Aboriginal]] women accessing services would
be recognized as helpers just as much as those who are formally
employed to serve them. This approach recognizes that formal service providers have just as much to learn and benefit as much from
helping relationships as those accessing services. Interconnectedness
and interdependence considers the relationships between all things,
and in the context of the health and well-being this reflects an understanding that the health of the collective is impacted by the health of
the individual just as the health of the individual is impacted by that
of the collective. If systems and providers of health social services
moved away from an individualist stance (your health and wellbeing is your problem) to a collectivist stance, then we could operate
as a society that understands how the illness and marginalization of
some affects the health and well-being of all. Utilizing an [[Aboriginal]]
approach also firmly recognizes and honours the agency of [[Aboriginal]]
women in determining their own health and well-being and helps
to foster a system in which seeking help does not equate with being
helpless.
Notes
1. In this chapter, the terms ciswomen, women, and non-transwomen may
be used interchangeably. For those unfamiliar with the term, “A ciswoman, shorthand for ‘cissexual woman’ or ‘cisgender woman’, is [a]
non-transsexual woman—a woman whose assigned gender is female,
and whose assigned female gender is more or less consistent with her
personal sense of self. This distinguishes her from transwomen, shorthand for ‘transsexual women’—women who were initially assigned a
male gender, but have a female identity. If you identify as a woman but
are not a transsexual woman, you’re a ciswoman” (Head n.d.).

2. Traditionally, in ‘staged’ photography the artists take on the role of the
director, creating or staging an image (McDonald 1999). They use models, props, costumes or lighting, often creating a sense of theatre that is
then photographed. This kind of photography has ties to theatre, dance,
sculpture, painting and literature. It is well suited to making stories from
experiences because the images that are photographed are always coming
out of context. The viewer is therefore invited to make the connections
between the ‘before’ and ‘after’ sections of the story.
