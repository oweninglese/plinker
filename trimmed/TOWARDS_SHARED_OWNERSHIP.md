 TOWARDS SHARED OWNERSHIP:
 PROPERTY, GEOGRAPHY, AND TREATY
 MAKING IN BRITISH COLUMBIA

 ABSTRACT. In British Columbia, Canada's westernmost prov-
 ince, unresolved Aboriginal claims to land remain highly conten-
 tious. Since the early 1990s, a unique treaty negotiation process
 has sought to resolve questions about land ownership and estab-
 lish a new relationship between Aboriginal peoples and the Crown.
 After almost two decades, the limitations of this treaty process are
 increasingly evident and answers to the land question remain elu-
 sive. This article examines this treaty-making process through a
 property lens, focusing on how particular models of property are
 privileged by and produced through this approach to treaty. I argue
 that the treaty process, as currently structured, works to entrench
 dominant Western forms of property across Aboriginal territories
 in a highly separate and unequal manner, and as such, serves to re-
 inscribe asymmetrical relations of power between Aboriginal peo-
 ples and the Crown. To a considerable extent, this asymmetrical
 approach to property making explains the lack of progress towards
 treaties. The final part of the article explores alternative approach-
 es to treaty proposed by Aboriginal groups. I argue that these pro-
 posals, which reflect Aboriginal understandings of property, offer
 a new and more promising direction for treaty making. In partic-
 ular, the emphasis on sharing lands and resources, as well as the
 wealth generated from these, provides a path to reconcile compet-
 ing property interests and to build a new and more respectful rela-
 tionship between the Crown and Aboriginal peoples. I suggest that
 the difficulties of treaty making in British Columbia reflect broad-
 er challenges associated with land restitution and reconciliation in
 settler colonies.

 Introduction
 In Canada, treaties have long played a key role in
 mediating relations between Aboriginal peoples and
 the Crown.1 While early treaties furthered military
 or economic relationships, by the late nineteenth
 century the Crown relied on treaty making primar-
 ily to secure land for an expanding settler nation.
 Between 1850 and 1923, land cession treaties extin-
 guished Aboriginal title to vast areas of central and
 western Canada (Miller 2009). In British Columbia,
 however, few historic treaties were completed, and
 questions of land title remained unresolved across
 most of the province. This uncertainty over land
 ownership in Canada's westernmost province,
 heightened by an effective Aboriginal land claims
 movement, led to the creation, in the early 1990s,
 of a unique treaty-making process. Under this pro-
 cess, three parties - Canada, British Columbia and
 Aboriginal groups - seek to negotiate modern com-
 prehensive treaties to clearly define Aboriginal and
 Crown rights to land and natural resources. By re-
 solving the land question, and establishing a form of
 Aboriginal self-governance, the treaty process was
 to help create 'a new relationship based on mutual
 trust, respect and understanding' between the Crown
 and Aboriginal peoples in British Columbia (British
 Columbia 1991, p. 7).
 Treaty making in British Columbia has proven
 to be a highly contested and painfully slow process.
 After two decades of negotiation, only two treaties
 have been finalized while negotiations at some four
 dozen other treaty tables are stalled or progressing at
 only a glacial pace. A number of Aboriginal groups
 have withdrawn from treaty talks altogether and
 many others have refused to join the process at all,
 believing it to be flawed and ill-suited to their needs.
 Moreover, relations between the Crown and many
 Aboriginal groups in the province remain strained,
 burdened with longstanding disputes and misunder-
 standings. Reflecting on these challenges, in late
 2011 Sophie Pierre, Chief Commissioner for the
 BC Treaty Commission, called on all three parties
 to provide a new direction for the treaty process. If
 the process cannot be fixed, she bluntly concluded,
 it should be shut down (Lavoie 201 1).
 In this article, I examine modern treaty making
 in British Columbia through a property lens. While a
 number of scholars have highlighted the limitations
 of the treaty process (e.g. Day and Sadik 2002; de
 Costa 2003; Woolford 2005), none have explored
 the role of property in the contemporary effort to re-
 solve Aboriginal land claims in the province.2 Yet
 at its core, the treaty process is centrally concerned

 with property. It was created to resolve the dispute
 between First Nations and the Crown over property
 in land, with treaties establishing certainty about
 who "owns" what land across the province and serv-
 ing to reconcile Crown and Aboriginal land titles.
 Part of the failure to conclude more treaties, I argue,
 can be attributed to the Crown's insistence on re-
 solving the land dispute primarily through reference
 to the dominant Western model of property, what
 Singer (2000) calls the "ownership model". Relying
 on this model, the process seeks to demarcate a clear
 boundary between Aboriginal and Crown lands,
 thus reproducing distinct spaces of Aboriginal and
 settler (non- Aboriginal) life. Moreover, it seeks to
 do so in a highly unequal fashion, as the property re-
 covered by First Nations through treaty comprises a
 small fraction of their ancestral lands. Rather than
 establishing a new relationship between the Crown
 and Aboriginal peoples, this approach works to rein-
 force the asymmetrical relations of power that have
 long characterized Crown-Aboriginal relations in
 British Columbia.
 I begin by situating treaty making in British
 Columbia within a broader scholarly discussion of
 land dispossession and contemporary land restitu-
 tion in settler colonies. I then review different un-
 derstandings of property, focusing in particular on
 key differences between Western and Aboriginal
 conceptions of property. I examine the role of prop-
 erty in the historic dispossession of Aboriginal peo-
 ples and then turn to the treaty process in British
 Columbia, exploring how different ideas about
 property are mobilized in negotiations and how
 property gets transformed and produced through
 treaty making. Central to this reworking of property
 is the deployment of a particular approach to achiev-
 ing "certainty" on the question of land ownership,
 which transforms a territorially expansive under-
 standing of Aboriginal title into a spatially confined
 form of property called fee simple plus. Aboriginal
 opposition to this approach is a key reason for the
 lack of progress at many treaty tables. I conclude
 by exploring a number of alternative approaches
 to resolving the land question, as proposed by First
 Nations. I argue that these proposals, which reflect
 particularly Aboriginal conceptions of property, il-
 luminate a path beyond the current treaty impasse.
 Based on the idea of shared property rights, these
 proposals provide a means to not only resolve the
 land question but also to establish a new and more
 equal relationship between Aboriginal peoples and
 the Crown.
 Settler colonialism, land restitution, and
 property
 The past decade has seen a burgeoning scholarly in-
 terest in historical and contemporary dimensions
 of settler colonialism (Elkins and Pedersen 2005;
 Coombes 2006; Bateman and Pilkington 2011).
 Settler colonialism is described as a transnational
 phenomenon distinct from other colonial forma-
 tions, a key distinction being that settlers carry sov-
 ereignty with them and found new political orders
 in the spaces they colonize (Veracini 2010). Unlike
 other forms of colonialism, which exploit Aboriginal
 labour and local resources to benefit an expanding
 metropole, in settler colonialism the land itself is the
 primary interest. For Wolfe (2006), the logic of set-
 tler colonialism is one of elimination, as Aboriginal
 peoples must be removed so that settlers can pos-
 sess their lands and the settler state can secure their
 territories. Thus, the histories of settler states like
 Aotearoa New Zealand, Australia, Canada, South
 Africa and the United States are marked by ef-
 forts to dispossess Aboriginal peoples of their an-
 cestral lands and to eliminate Aboriginal societies
 from the national physical and imaginative land-
 scape (Banivanua Mar and Edmonds 2010). The
 logic of elimination is variously expressed through
 warfare, spatial displacement and the assimilation
 of Aboriginal subjects into settler society (Wolfe
 2011).
 The limited success of these colonial projects is
 evidenced by continuing Aboriginal struggles over
 land in settler states around the globe and in the con-
 temporary efforts of many settler states to resolve
 these challenges through programmes of land res-
 titution (van Meijl and Goldsmith 2003; Langton
 et al. 2004; Fay and James 2010). In this sense, mod-
 ern treaty making in British Columbia can be un-
 derstood as one manifestation of this broader global
 project of restitution and reconciliation. Key to un-
 derstanding treaty making in British Columbia, and
 to land restitution in settler colonies more gener-
 ally, is Wolfe's (1999, p. 2) point that colonial 'inva-
 sion is a structure not an event'. Settlers come to stay
 and implant legal, political and economic structures
 that come to dominate in settler states. Of particu-
 lar relevance are Western property regimes, which
 constitute a particularly powerful structure in set-
 tler colonies, embedding dominant legal and polit-
 ical-economic ideas across state territories. In these
 contexts, Aboriginal dispossession and displace-
 ment is an ongoing process as the settler state works
 to constrain Aboriginal claims to land and political

 self-determination within these dominant struc-
 tures. Veracini (2007, p. 25) notes that this contain-
 ment also works on a discursive level, as there is 'no
 intuitive/acceptable narrative of settler colonial de-
 colonization, and/or Indigenous/national reconcili-
 ation'. Within such constraints, contemporary land
 restitution efforts, such as modern treaty making in
 British Columbia, tend to reproduce colonial struc-
 tures and relations.
 Western and Aboriginal property
 From a Western perspective, property is most com-
 monly understood to refer to things that one pos-
 sesses or "owns". A more formal understanding of
 property, from within Western legal tradition, makes
 reference to rights in or to things. Property provides
 a bundle of such rights, including the right of own-
 ers to use their property as they wish, to exclude oth-
 ers, and to transfer title of their property to others.
 In liberal capitalist states like Canada, the "own-
 ership model" dominates the way we think about
 property (Singer 2000). At the centre of this model
 is the owner, understood to hold all (or almost all)
 of the rights associated with property. When prop-
 erty disputes arise, the rights of the owner are given
 precedence and the onus is on others (e.g. non-
 owners, the state) to explain why these rights should
 be infringed or limited. Further, owners are seen as
 "self-regarding", largely concerned with their own
 proprietary interests and free of obligations to those
 beyond their property lines (Singer 2000, p. 30).
 From this perspective, property is equated with pri-
 vate property - an exclusive individual right to prop-
 erty - and the ideal property form is fee simple title,
 an estate in land considered to be the most complete
 form of individual private property ownership rec-
 ognized in law (Macpherson 1978).
 According to the ownership model, property
 can have only one owner and a clear line is drawn
 between this owner and non-owners. Properties, in
 this model, do not overlap. The right of the owner to
 exclude non-owners is fundamental to this under-
 standing of property. Also key is seeing property as
 fungible, a thing that can be possessed, separated
 from the owner, and traded in the market. In a market
 economy, property's real value rests on its exchange
 value. This dominant model also embodies a partic-
 ular spatial form, with the owner's rights neatly con-
 tained within clearly delineated property boundaries
 (Blomley 2004, pp. 5-6). Property, in this formula-
 tion, is a well defined space of individual freedom
 and autonomy, a bulwark against the state and the
 larger collective. This model posits property as
 fixed, objective, pre-political and certain.
 The ownership model may dominate the way
 we think about property and tell us what property
 ought to look like, but the way that property actu-
 ally works on the ground is somewhat different
 (Underkuffler-Freund 1996). While the dominant
 model emphasizes the freedom and autonomy of
 owners, separate and secure within the bounds of
 their property, closer scrutiny suggests a more com-
 plex relationship between property holders and so-
 ciety. Property rights are not separate from but rather
 embedded in, and dependent on, social and political
 relations. Property rights are protected by the state,
 in property law, and rely on broad social agreement
 to function effectively. Property, even private prop-
 erty, requires a kind of social consensus and must
 persuade us of its usefulness and legitimacy (Rose
 1994). In everyday life, then, property is not fixed,
 objective and beyond politics, but rather fluid, con-
 tingent and open to contestation (Blomley 2004, p.
 14). The contingent and contested nature of prop-
 erty is particularly evident in settler states, where
 Western property regimes overlay pre-existing and
 continuing Aboriginal property systems. The unsta-
 ble legal foundation of settler property systems in
 Canada is highlighted by Borrows (1999, p. 558),
 who notes how the Crown's assertion of sover-
 eignty somehow transmuted Aboriginal possession
 of lands and resources into 'the golden bedrock of
 Crown title'.
 In contrast to the ownership model, critical legal
 scholars articulate a broader conception of property,
 one that recognizes the centrality of social relations
 to this institution. Rather than being centrally con-
 cerned with organizing a person's rights to things ,
 they argue, property is more fully and usefully un-
 derstood as being about organizing relations be-
 tween people with respect to things (e.g. Nedelsky
 1993; Cooper 2007). Understood in this way, prop-
 erty becomes a more complex concept, bound up
 with questions of identity, belonging, citizenship,
 freedom, status and economic progress. Seeing
 property as a historically contingent social institu-
 tion, one deeply enmeshed in, and constitutive of,
 social and political relations, allows us to move be-
 yond hegemonic understandings of property and
 consider alternative ways of organizing property to
 meet various social, economic and political goals
 (Macpherson 1973). Further, understanding prop-
 erty as a socio-cultural practice acknowledges that

 conceptions of property vary from culture to culture,
 reflecting not only variations in modes of owning
 and possessing but very different ways of relating to
 the world at large. In a process like treaty making,
 centrally concerned with negotiating new property
 relations between Aboriginal and settler cultures,
 paying attention to the socio-cultural dimensions of
 property is critically important.
 Bryan (2000) argues that there is no univer-
 sal Aboriginal conception of property, noting that
 understandings of property vary greatly across
 Aboriginal cultures. Just as there is no unitary
 Aboriginal identity so there is no unitary Aboriginal
 model of property, as Indigenous peoples have de-
 veloped distinctive property systems to suit their par-
 ticular ecological, economic and political contexts.
 While a universal definition of Aboriginal property
 may be neither possible nor useful, it is possible to
 identify a number of differences between Aboriginal
 and Western conceptions of property. I focus here on
 three areas where Aboriginal property conceptions
 may be distinguished from the dominant Western
 model - relating to the spatiality, fungibility and
 exclusivity of property - all of which reflect and
 shape different ways of relating to the world, to the
 land and to the people around us. It should be noted
 that while I emphasize important differences be-
 tween Western and Aboriginal conceptions of prop-
 erty - and in particular between somewhat idealized
 property models, the ownership model on one hand
 and more traditional Aboriginal property models
 on the other - there are also many similarities be-
 tween them. In settler colonies, Aboriginal peoples
 are typically adept in both property systems, and of-
 ten draw on Western property concepts to make their
 land claims intelligible to the state and to advance
 their objective of regaining control over their ances-
 tral territory and the resources it contains (Nadasdy
 2002).
 In their idealized forms, Western and Aboriginal
 conceptions of property differ in their spatial
 form. The cadastral map provides the clearest im-
 age of property's spatial form under the ownership
 model, a grid of land parcels with clear, unambigu-
 ous boundaries. Within the property grid, relations
 between property holder, property and fellow citi-
 zens are mediated through the notion of ownership.
 Propertied spaces are seen as spaces of separation
 and autonomy. Aboriginal conceptions of prop-
 erty embody a different kind of spatiality, less reli-
 ant on the enclosure of property rights within clearly
 bounded spaces and defined more by the allocation
 of property rights on what Banner (1999, p. 811)
 calls a "functional" basis. In traditional Maori prop-
 erty systems, Banner notes, several different indi-
 viduals or family groups can hold property rights
 in the same area. Within one area, for example, the
 rights to fish, hunt, till the ground and gather berries
 can be allocated to different individuals or groups.
 In his study of Coast Salish peoples on British
 Columbia's south coast, Thom provides a similarly
 complex picture of the spatiality of Aboriginal prop-
 erty. In this region, property boundaries are perme-
 able, with property rights constituted through 'ideas
 and practices of kin, travel, descent and sharing'
 (Thom 2009, p. 179). From an Aboriginal perspec-
 tive, property boundaries are as much about draw-
 ing lines of relation or connection as they are about
 marking lines of separation.
 Central to the ownership model is the idea that
 property is fungible, a "thing" (or an object) that
 is interchangeable or replaceable with something
 else and that 'can be separated - legally, physically,
 and emotionally - from the one who possesses it'
 (Cooper 2007, p. 629). The spatial form of property
 under the ownership model, an unambiguous plot of
 land with one individual owner, makes it easier to
 see property as a thing that can be owned and traded
 in the market. Bryan (2000, p. 28) argues that fun-
 gibility is uncommon in Aboriginal understandings
 of property. In Aboriginal worldviews, he notes, a
 thing may embody a specific person or relationship;
 a tree may be someone's grandfather, for example,
 a mountain may embody a mythical spirit or ances-
 tor. As a result, things are not always interchangea-
 ble with each other; one piece of land is not the same
 as another, all trees are not the same. The idea of
 land being separable from the property holder is also
 less common in Aboriginal worldviews, where land
 is often understood not as a lifeless substrate but as
 a lively presence or a ground from which things de-
 velop and grow, and through which Aboriginal iden-
 tities are constituted (Ingold 2000, p. 133). Common
 to many Aboriginal worldviews is the understand-
 ing that all things are related and connected to each
 other (Shaw et al. 2006; Mack 2011). Aboriginal
 conceptions of property reflect this relational ontol-
 ogy, which emphasizes connections and relations
 between humans, ancestors, spirit beings, animals,
 plants, and what most Westerners would consider
 inanimate nature (Feit 2004; Ingold 2004). Shaped
 by this worldview, it is difficult to frame Aboriginal
 property understandings within Western ideas about
 ownership (Bryan 2000; Nadasdy 2002).

 TOWARDS SHARED OWNERSHIP
 The ability to exclude others from one's prop-
 erty is also key to the ownership model. Private
 property entails fences and "No Trespassing" signs,
 and owners rely on the state to remove non-owners
 from their land. Property owners see themselves
 as having few, if any, obligations to those who live
 beyond the boundaries of their property. The abil-
 ity to exclude is also common to Aboriginal prop-
 erty systems, which provide rules for access to land
 and natural resources. Depending on the Aboriginal
 group and the type of resource involved, access
 rights may be held by individuals, families or the
 tribe. However, as Thom discusses in the case of
 Coast Salish peoples, a pervasive ethic of sharing
 and reciprocity often allows "owned" resources to
 be opened up to others, not only to close and distant
 relations but also, when proper protocols are fol-
 lowed, to those with no clear claims to ownership
 (Thom 2005). More generally, scholars have noted
 that ethics of sharing, reciprocity, and redistribution
 are common to Aboriginal conceptions of property
 (e.g. Ingold 1986; Tully 2000; Gombay 2010). What
 may appear as the absence of clear property rules
 - the sharing of lands and resources, for example,
 or the redistribution of wealth through ceremonies
 such as potlatches - actually represent ways of or-
 ganizing relations between different social groups
 with respect to important properties, including lands
 and natural resources.
 Unmaking Aboriginal property
 In settler states, colonialism relies on the displace-
 ment and dispossession of Aboriginal peoples to
 open up lands for European settlers. The colonial
 project entails the "unmaking" of Aboriginal space,
 the transformation of ancestral territories into co-
 lonial properties (Raibmon 2008). Dispossessed of
 their territories, Aboriginal peoples have to be lo-
 cated elsewhere; thus, settler colonialism also re-
 quired a "making" (or re-making) of Aboriginal
 space, albeit on a much more limited scale (Harris
 2002). The production of these colonial geographies
 is neither easy nor frictionless, as Aboriginal peo-
 ples resist displacement and dispossession at every
 turn. As Said (1994, p. 7) puts it, colonialism entails
 a Struggle over geography', a contest not only over
 the remaking of material space (land) but also over
 how spaces are conceived and imagined. As a spa-
 tial-legal concept and an institution that shapes so-
 cio-economic and political relations, property serves
 as both a key tool in dispossession and a productive
 site of Aboriginal resistance (Harris 2004, p. 177).
 Across settler colonial states today, these struggles
 over property and geography continue.
 European misconceptions of Aboriginal prop-
 erty are evident from the earliest encounters
 between these two groups. In 1493, Columbus ex-
 pressed doubt about whether the Aboriginal peoples
 he encountered in America had private property, ob-
 serving that they appeared to share in whatever an-
 yone had (Berkhofer 1978, p. 6). The notion that
 Aboriginal peoples held all things in common -
 meaning, in effect, that they had no property systems
 at all - became central to settler colonial discourse
 and served to legitimate European appropriation of
 Aboriginal land in many different settings (Williams
 1990, pp. 208-212; Banner 1999, 2005; Weaver
 2003). The failure to find familiar visual cues of land
 ownership - such as fences or enclosed gardens, in
 the case of English settlers - reinforced European
 beliefs that Aboriginal peoples lacked any concep-
 tion of property (Cronon 1983; Seed 1995). Settlers
 adopted a Lockean view, where America repre-
 sented the world as it was in the beginning, a land
 without property, and the frontier, the imagined line
 between civilization and savagery, was where prop-
 erty was created through the application of settler la-
 bour to raw nature (Arneil 1996; Blomley 2003).
 In Canada, land cession treaties were the primary
 vehicles for effecting the displacement of Aboriginal
 peoples and the appropriation of Aboriginal prop-
 erties. Although treaties formally extinguished
 Aboriginal title across much of Western Canada
 in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centu-
 ries, few such agreements were concluded in British
 Columbia.3 For a brief period, colonial authorities
 in British Columbia did recognize Aboriginal prop-
 erty rights and sought to secure space for settle-
 ment by purchasing land from Aboriginal groups.
 Between 1850 and 1854, colonial governor James
 Douglas concluded 14 land purchase agreements
 with Aboriginal groups on Vancouver Island, secur-
 ing about 93,000 hectares of land for colonial set-
 tlement (Tennant 1990, pp. 17-25). When Douglas
 retired in 1864, however, control over land policy
 fell to colonial authorities much less sympathetic to
 Aboriginal peoples and their land rights, and the de-
 nial of Aboriginal property rights became firmly en-
 trenched in British Columbia's colonial leadership.
 This denial, which continued under the new provin-
 cial leadership once British Columbia became part
 of the Dominion of Canada in 1871, fundamentally
 shaped the province's early land policy.

 The denial of Aboriginal land rights obviated
 the need to purchase Aboriginal lands or to take
 any formal legal measures, such as treaty making,
 to extinguish Aboriginal title.4 From the Crown's
 perspective, Aboriginal land needs could be met
 through the creation of a system of Indian reserves,
 which would simultaneously open up Aboriginal
 territories to settler appropriation. As Harris (2002,
 p. 261) documents, the construction of British
 Columbia's Indian reserve system was a drawn out
 and one-sided affair; when completed in the 1920s,
 1,536 reserves had been mapped out encompass-
 ing about one-third of 1 per cent of the province's
 land area, meaning that more than 99 per cent of
 the province was made available for settlers and the
 settler state. The reserves that made up this system
 tended to be small, particularly when compared to
 Indian reserve allocations elsewhere in Canada or
 in the United States, reflecting the desire of provin-
 cial leaders to minimize the amount of land set aside
 for Aboriginal communities. Restricted to village
 and critical resource procurement sites, Indian re-
 serves were demarcated so as not to inhibit the land
 demands of the growing settler population. Under
 this system, Aboriginal life was increasingly con-
 strained within a grid of settler private and public
 properties (Fig. 1), with the boundary drawn around
 reserves coming to mark important differences in
 socio-economic status and civil, political, and legal
 rights for Aboriginal and non- Aboriginal peoples in
 British Columbia.5
 While the focus here is on the taking of
 Aboriginal lands, First Nation communities in
 British Columbia and across Canada have long been
 subject to other forms of dispossession, marginaliza-
 tion, and political control. Key to this is the federal
 Indian Act , originally passed in 1876, which allows
 the federal government to define who is (and is not)
 a "status Indian" and to administer and regulate the
 lives of Aboriginal peoples. Under the Indian Act ,
 Canada outlawed important Aboriginal socio-cul-
 tural institutions, such as the potlatch (Cole and
 Chaikin 1990), imposed foreign systems of com-
 munity governance, and prohibited First Nations
 from engaging in political and legal activity in pur-
 suit of their land claims (Tennant 1990). While some
 of the most harmful elements of the law were re-
 moved in subsequent decades, the Indian Act re-
 mained in place as a key part of the broader settler
 colonial structure shaping Aboriginal lives. Perhaps
 most damaging was the federal government's resi-
 dential school system, in which Aboriginal children
 were taken from their families and "educated" in
 centralized boarding schools (Milloy 1999). A key
 tool in the federal government's effort to assimilate
 Aboriginal peoples into settler society, the residen-
 tial school system spawned untold social and cul-
 tural dislocation among Aboriginal communities,
 the legacy of which the nation is only now begin-
 ning to comprehend (Regan 2010). For Aboriginal
 peoples in Canada, this colonial history continues to
 reverberate in the present, affecting their everyday
 lives in myriad ways and generating deep mistrust
 of Crown policies and programmes.
 Modern treaty making in British Columbia
 The dispossession of Aboriginal peoples was never
 fully accomplished, as First Nations across British
 Columbia resisted confinement to small Indian re-
 serves and continuously asserted rights to land
 and resources across their broader ancestral terri-
 tories (Tennant 1990). Over the past four decades,
 this resistance has yielded important advances for
 Aboriginal land rights, particularly in the legal
 realm. Starting with the Supreme Court of Canada's
 1973 decision in the Calder case, a series of court
 decisions has dismissed the Crown's argument that
 Aboriginal title had long been extinguished and has
 established in Canadian law the continuing exist-
 ence of Aboriginal property rights across much of
 British Columbia, including on ancestral lands out-
 side of Indian reserves (Godlewska and Webber
 2007). In the 1980s, Aboriginal blockades of re-
 source extraction activities across the province, in
 combination with pressure from the courts, forced
 the Crown to engage with First Nations on the land
 issue (Blomley 1996). This led, in 1990, to the es-
 tablishment of the BC Claims Task Force, charged
 with finding a way to negotiate the resolution of
 Aboriginal land claims in the province (McKee
 2009, pp. 26-31).
 In 1991, the task force recommended that First
 Nations, Canada and British Columbia 'establish
 a new relationship based on mutual trust, respect
 and understanding - through political negotiations'
 (British Columbia 1 99 1 , p. 8). This new relationship,
 it was further asserted, was to be achieved through
 'voluntary negotiations, fairly conducted, in which
 the First Nations, Canada, and British Columbia
 are equal participants'. Negotiations would move
 through six stages, producing modern comprehen-
 sive treaties that would resolve competing interests

 gal systems, intergovernmental relations, financial
 compensation, and the provision of government ser-
 vices. Defining treaty making as a process of po-
 litical negotiations represented an important shift
 in approach for the federal government, which, up
 to that point, had required Aboriginal claimants to
 clearly demonstrate their title to land according to
 narrow Euro-Canadian criteria. The treaty process
 proposed for British Columbia would require no
 such discussion of Aboriginal property rights; rather
 negotiations would focus on Aboriginal peoples'
 claims to self-defined traditional territories (Thom
 2009).
 The task force pointed to certainty as a key is-
 sue to be addressed in treaty talks. Competing
 Aboriginal and Crown claims to the land created un-
 certainty about ownership and jurisdiction, which
 treaties were intended to resolve. While certainty on
 the question of land ownership had, up to that point,
 been achieved through blanket extinguishment of
 Aboriginal title, the task force explicitly rejected
 this approach. Rather, it argued, the 'parties must
 strive to achieve certainty through treaties which
 state precisely each party's rights, duties, and juris-
 diction' (British Columbia 1991, p. 11).
 The creation of the British Columbia Treaty
 Commission in 1993, an independent body charged
 with monitoring the negotiations process, marked
 the onset of modern treaty making in British
 Columbia. Under this process, treaty negotiations
 are organized around First Nations' traditional ter-
 ritories. First Nations initiate the process by submit-
 ting a Statement of Intent to the Treaty Commission,
 indicating their desire to negotiate and identifying
 the area, or traditional territory, that is to be subject
 to treaty talks. (By way of example, Fig. 2 shows the
 traditional territory of the Tsawwassen First Nation,
 located in southwestern British Columbia, as identi-
 fied in its Statement of Intent submitted to the Treaty
 Commission in 1993.) The Commission was quickly
 flooded with Statements of Intent; by 1996 some

 four dozen First Nations had entered the treaty pro-
 cess (BC Treaty Commission 1997). In December
 2012, there were 60 First Nations in treaty negotia-
 tions at 49 different treaty tables, representing about
 two-thirds of the province's Aboriginal population
 (BC Treaty Commission 201 la).
 Progress towards treaty settlements has been
 slow. By late 2012, only two final treaty agreements
 had been ratified, with the Tsawwassen and Maa-
 nulth First Nations respectively, while a dozen other
 Aboriginal groups had progressed to stage five or six
 of the process, indicating that a final agreement was
 likely at these tables within a few years. However,
 80 per cent of First Nations engaged in the process
 remained far from a final treaty agreement; twenty-
 nine Aboriginal groups had not progressed beyond
 stage four, where negotiations over substantive is-
 sues like land and governance take place, and an ad-
 ditional nineteen groups remained in the process
 but were no longer actively negotiating (BC Treaty
 Commission 2011b). In 2007, eight First Nations
 withdrew from treaty negotiations, concluding that
 an equitable deal was not possible under the pro-
 cess.6 In addition, a significant minority (about 40
 per cent) of British Columbia's First Nations, rep-
 resenting approximately one-third of the province's
 Aboriginal population, had chosen not to enter the
 treaty process at all, seeing the process as flawed and
 ill suited to their needs (British Columbia 2006, p.
 19).
 There are numerous impediments to treaty mak-
 ing in British Columbia. At many treaty tables the
 gap between what the Crown is offering, in terms
 of the amount of land and other treaty benefits
 (e.g. cash, access to natural resources), and what
 Aboriginal communities are seeking is large. There
 are also significant differences between Crown and
 Aboriginal negotiators over issues such as the na-
 ture of Aboriginal self-governance, the application
 of federal and provincial laws, and intergovern-
 mental fiscal relations - all key elements of modern
 treaties (BC Treaty Commission 2008). The fram-
 ing of treaty making as a process focused on es-
 tablishing a new relationship for the future, rather
 than one concerned with addressing past injustices,
 is problematic for many First Nations. The failure
 to address the colonial past in any meaningful way
 means that compensation for historic infringement
 of Aboriginal title and rights, something of impor-
 tance to many First Nations, is not on the table for
 negotiation (Day and Sadik 2002).
 While all of these issues impede progress
 towards treaty, perhaps the most difficult challenge
 relates to the question of how to achieve certainty
 on the land question. While certainty of land own-
 ership is important to all negotiating parties in the
 treaty process, for the Crown this issue is seen as
 particularly critical. Unresolved Aboriginal land
 claims create an uncertain climate for private in-
 vestment in land and natural resource sectors (e.g.
 forestry, mining, oil and gas), which generate sig-
 nificant Crown revenues in British Columbia. By
 removing this uncertainty, the Crown argues, trea-
 ties will provide economic benefits to all British
 Columbians, Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal (BC
 Treaty Commission 2004). For many First Nations
 engaged in the treaty process, however, the certainty
 model employed by the Crown is deeply problem-
 atic, requiring them to cede their property claims
 to their larger traditional territories in exchange for
 secure ownership over a much smaller area. First
 Nation opposition to this certainty model is a major
 reason that talks are stalled at many treaty tables.
 Reworking property and geography
 The British Columbia treaty process is centrally
 concerned with property. It was created to resolve
 a longstanding property dispute between the Crown
 and Aboriginal communities. At its core, it seeks to
 achieve clarity and certainty with respect to Crown
 and Aboriginal ownership of land within specific
 Aboriginal territories and, by extension, across
 the breadth of the province. However, Crown and
 Aboriginal groups have very different ideas about
 how this certainty is to be accomplished. From a
 Crown perspective, treaty making is seen as a tool
 to transform Aboriginal title - which it views as an
 ill-defined and geographically amorphous property
 claim - into a more certain and spatially delimited
 set of property rights. Final treaty agreements clearly
 set out the land and resource rights of the Aboriginal
 signatories in exhaustive detail and in highly legal-
 istic and technical language. Through these agree-
 ments, "treaty settlement lands" - which include
 existing Indian reserves and any additional lands
 identified in the treaty - are designated as properties
 owned by the Aboriginal signatory in fee simple.
 The treaty process is based on what is called a
 land selection model, whereby the Crown identifies
 parcels of land within a First Nation's traditional ter-
 ritory that may be included in a treaty. Through the
 negotiation process, a subset of these lands is then se-
 lected for inclusion in the final treaty agreement. It is

 important to note that this selection process is asym-
 metrical, as the Crown reserves itself the right to de-
 termine whether or not a particular area of land can
 be included in a treaty agreement. This model, cen-
 tral to land claims negotiations across Canada, was
 clearly evident in the first modern treaty finalized in
 British Columbia - with the Nisga'a Nation in 1999
 - and remains central to the treaty process.7 Figure
 3 provides a graphical illustration of the end result
 of the land selection model of treaty making for the
 Tsawwassen First Nation, showing how the original
 Indian reserve lands have been expanded by the ad-
 dition of adjacent land parcels selected through the
 negotiation process.8 Tsawwassen treaty settlement
 lands comprise a small fraction of the Tsawwassen
 Nation's traditional territory, highlighting how this
 approach to treaty making works to spatially de-
 limit Aboriginal property rights. The Crown's desire
 for certainty on the land question is met by identi-
 fying, through treaty agreements, precisely where
 Aboriginal property rights exist and where they do
 not.
 While treaty agreements clearly establish
 Aboriginal property rights over treaty lands, they
 effectively extinguish Aboriginal property claims
 across larger ancestral territories. While the term
 "extinguishment" has been expunged from modern
 treaty language, the "modification" and "release"
 provisions of treaty agreements have much the same
 effect.9 Aboriginal treaty signatories agree to the
 modification of their Aboriginal property rights as
 set out in the treaty, and to the release of the Crown
 and other persons from all past, present and future
 claims it may have (or have had) relating to 4 any act
 or omission ... that may have affected, interfered
 with or infringed any aboriginal right, including ab-
 original title' (Tsawwassen First Nation et al. 2007,
 p. 23). To further address the Crown's need for cer-
 tainty and close off any potential future claims, the
 treaty is understood to constitute 'the full and final
 settlement in respect of the aboriginal rights, includ-
 ing aboriginal title' òf the Aboriginal signatories
 (Tsawwassen First Nation et al. 2007, p. 22).
 Treaty settlements rely on fee simple property,
 seen, from a Western perspective, as 'the largest es-
 tate known in law' (Tsawwassen First Nation et al.
 2007, p. 39). More specifically, under the British
 Columbia treaty process, treaty settlement lands
 take the form of fee simple plus, an approach de-
 signed to provide Aboriginal groups with the cer-
 tainty that their treaty lands will never be fully and
 permanently alienated from them. Like any fee

 simple titleholder, the Aboriginal landowner may
 transfer or sell its property in land to any other per-
 son. However, under the fee simple plus model, if
 treaty lands ever revert to the Crown, they will be
 returned to the Aboriginal treaty signatory without
 charge. Despite these assurances, the designation of
 treaty settlement lands as an estate in fee simple (in-
 cluding fee simple plus) remains troubling for many
 First Nations. Fee simple derives from the Anglo-
 Saxon feudal property system in which the land-
 holder does not technically own the land but rather
 is considered a tenant of the Crown, which contin-
 ues to hold underlying title. The idea of being a ten-
 ant of the Crown does not fit with the vision many
 Aboriginal groups have of their relationship to both
 the Crown and their ancestral lands (Pesklevits
 2007).
 While treaties transform Aboriginal title into a
 kind of property that meshes more smoothly with
 the Canadian legal system, the Crown also works to
 shield some forms of property from the negotiation
 process altogether. Canada and British Columbia
 have both asserted that they will not expropriate pri-
 vate property in order to settle treaties. In addition,
 British Columbia has committed itself to ensuring
 that private interests in Crown lands, such as com-
 mercial tenures to extract natural resources (e.g. tim-
 ber, water, minerals), will not be negatively affected
 by treaties. Where such adverse effects are unavoid-
 able, the provincial government has committed it-
 self to fair and timely compensation of these rights
 holders (British Columbia 1996).
 Although most First Nations have no de-
 sire to see private lands expropriated, a number
 of Aboriginal groups argue that the issue of pri-
 vate property should be open for discussion at the
 treaty table. This is particularly true for Aboriginal
 groups in more intensively developed areas of the
 province, whose territories have been subject to ex-
 tensive land and resource privatization. For these
 groups, the Crown's historic sale or granting of land
 in their traditional territories to private individuals
 and corporations, without their prior consent, is un-
 derstood as an illegal taking of their property. Like
 any other property owner, they argue, they should
 be compensated for the taking of their land. Indeed,
 some argue that their Aboriginal title continues to
 exist on private lands and that they should be con-
 sulted when land use decisions are contemplated,
 especially when it comes to managing important
 cultural sites (e.g. burial grounds). The Crown, how-
 ever, has clearly stated that it will not compensate
 First Nations for 'past use and alienation of the
 lands and resources within their traditional territo-
 ries' (British Columbia 1996, no pagination) and as-
 serts that Aboriginal title has been extinguished on
 private lands.
 Modern treaty making in British Columbia is
 also centrally concerned with geography, as the
 reworking of property entails a simultaneous re-
 working of Aboriginal and settler space. The treaty
 process does work to expand the space available to
 Aboriginal peoples within their traditional territo-
 ries: treaty agreements identify lands that become
 the property of the Aboriginal signatories and may
 also formalize Aboriginal access to resources (e.g.
 fish, wildlife, migratory birds, water) located be-
 yond the boundaries of treaty settlement lands. The
 package of land and other material benefits (e.g.
 cash, resource access) offered to Aboriginal groups
 in British Columbia through treaty varies from place
 to place, depending on factors such as the price of
 land, the local availability of natural resources, and
 the size (population) of the Aboriginal group. At
 each treaty table in the province, Crown negotia-
 tors work within an overall "financial mandate" that
 determines the size of this package in gross mone-
 tary terms. In negotiating treaties across the prov-
 ince, the Crown seeks to offer all Aboriginal groups
 a roughly similar set of benefits, in terms of the gross
 monetary value of the package on a per capita basis
 (Proverbs 2010).
 This standardized approach to treaty making,
 wherein all Aboriginal groups are offered treaty
 benefits of the same gross financial value on a per
 capita basis, means that the extent to which treaties
 expand Aboriginal space varies from place to place.
 Where market land values are very high, as in urban
 or suburban areas, the amount of land offered will be
 small, whereas in rural areas treaty agreements will
 include a much larger allocation of land. The two fi-
 nal agreements completed under the treaty process
 to date illustrate the extent to which real property
 values shape the size of the land offer. In the case of
 the Tsawwassen treaty, covering an area just south
 of Vancouver, the treaty yielded 1.2 hectares of new
 land (on a per capita basis) for the Tsawwassen First
 Nation. For the Maa-nulth First Nations, located on
 the remote west coast of Vancouver Island, the treaty
 provided about 8 hectares of new land on a per cap-
 ita basis.
 This technical calculation of the amount of
 land allocated to Aboriginal groups through treaty
 is shaped by the Crown's broader objective of

 minimizing both its costs in the treaty process and
 the area over which its jurisdictions are fettered
 by Aboriginal rights after treaty. In the mid-1990s,
 when the treaty process was in its early stages, the
 Crown came under pressure from non-Aboriginal
 interests concerned about the extent to which trea-
 ties would impinge on the province's land and
 resource base. Resource industries, and the non-
 Aboriginal communities that rely on resource ex-
 traction, were particularly worried about a process
 that would re-allocate Crown property to Aboriginal
 communities. In response to this pressure, Mike
 Harcourt, then Premier of British Columbia, an-
 nounced that lands allocated to Aboriginal groups
 through treaty would amount to only 5 per cent of
 British Columbia's land area (McKee 2009, p. 70).
 This statement highlights the Crown's position that
 Aboriginal groups can only come to own or control
 a small portion of their traditional territories, with
 the rest confirmed as Crown property. In summary,
 through the existing treaty model the Crown seeks
 to transform Aboriginal title into a form of prop-
 erty more acceptable to the liberal democratic settler
 state - a spatially constrained form of fee simple ti-
 tle - and to achieve a full and final settlement on the
 question of Aboriginal land ownership.
 Alternatives
 Many Aboriginal groups in the British Columbia
 treaty process balk at the Crown's model for achiev-
 ing certainty on the land issue. For these groups,
 the notion of their ceding all claims to lands and re-
 sources across their ancestral territories in exchange
 for the package of benefits on offer from the Crown,
 particularly a small land and resource base, is a ma-
 jor obstacle to reaching agreement on treaty. The
 existing certainty model, like the treaty process it-
 self, is one sided: it meets the Crown's desire for cer-
 tainty but does not provide for the kind of certainty
 that First Nations seek. For many Aboriginal groups,
 certainty comes through the knowledge that they
 will have an important role in managing lands and
 natural resources across their traditional territories
 and that they will be able to share in the benefits that
 flow from these valuable assets. Aboriginal opposi-
 tion to this certainty model is also rooted in broader
 social and cultural concerns. Chief Edward John ar-
 gues that the idea of ceding Aboriginal title to their
 ancestral territory is anathema to many Aboriginal
 people (Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples
 1995, p. 46):
 When government asks us to agree to surrender
 our title and agree to its extinguishment, they ask
 us to do away with our most basic sense of our-
 selves, and our relationship to the Creator, our
 territory and the other peoples of the worlds. We
 could no longer do that without agreeing that we
 no longer wish to exist as a distinct people. That
 is completely at odds with our intentions in ne-
 gotiating treaties.
 Rather than resulting in its extinguishment, John
 and other First Nations leaders argue, treaties should
 provide for a clear recognition of Aboriginal title
 and rights throughout their territories. This need not
 mean ownership of all traditional lands, but rather
 the adoption of measures to allow Aboriginal peo-
 ples to maintain an ongoing and meaningful connec-
 tion to their territories.
 A number of First Nations have proposed alter-
 native approaches to treaty making and to the resolu-
 tion of questions about land and resource ownership
 and access. Here, I briefly review three such alterna-
 tives, proposed by the Hul 'qumi' num Treaty Group,
 the Gitxsan Nation and the Haida Nation, respec-
 tively. While different in some ways, these propos-
 als are similar in that they all provide an alternative
 to the existing certainty model, one that does not re-
 quire the extinguishment of Aboriginal title across
 their traditional territories. All three proposals, or
 alternative models, rely on the idea of Aboriginal
 peoples and the Crown working together to make
 decisions about lands and resources within tradi-
 tional territories and sharing in the benefits that
 flow from these lands. Rather than seeking to di-
 vide Aboriginal territories into separate Aboriginal
 and Crown properties, these models emphasize the
 overlapping and sharing of rights and responsibili-
 ties with respect to lands and resources.
 The Hul 'qumi 'num Treaty Group (HTG) rep-
 resents the treaty interests of six Coast Salish First
 Nations in British Columbia's south coastal region.
 While these groups have been at the treaty table since
 1993, in late 2012 they remained far from a final
 agreement (Egan 2012). In 2008 the HTG released
 a report identifying the current certainty model as
 a major impediment to treaty, arguing that it failed
 to offer the kind of certainty that First Nations need.
 More specifically, the report noted that this approach
 'does not provide First Nations with the necessary de-
 cision-making authority to protect, manage, or bene-
 fit from the natural resources within their traditional
 territories' (Olding et al. 2008, p. 6). What is needed,

 the HTG suggested, is 'a comprehensive new vision
 for treaties to act as a vehicle to implement shared de-
 cision-making throughout First Nations territories in
 British Columbia' (Olding et al. 2008, p. 2).
 According to the HTG proposal, shared decision-
 making over lands and natural resources would in-
 volve mutual recognition of Crown and Aboriginal
 titles and jurisdictions across traditional territories,
 eliminating the need to extinguish Aboriginal prop-
 erty rights. This alternative approach would involve
 a commitment by both parties, expressed within a
 treaty agreement, to shared decision-making across
 the traditional territory, while the specific details of
 the shared decision-making model would be nego-
 tiated and established outside the formal structure
 of treaty. Such an approach, the HTG report argued,
 would meet both Crown and Aboriginal needs for
 certainty. More broadly, the HTG report proposed
 a multi-level governance structure, with bodies at
 provincial, regional (sub-provincial), and local lev-
 els, to guide implementation of the shared decision-
 making model across the province.
 The Gitxsan Nation, based in northwestern
 British Columbia, has long argued for an alterna-
 tive approach to treaty making (Derrick 2004). The
 Gitxsan entered the treaty process in 1994 and, as of
 late 2012, were at stage four in the negotiation pro-
 cess. In 2008 the Gitxsan Treaty Team released a re-
 port rejecting the land selection model at the heart of
 the treaty process and describing an alternative ap-
 proach to reconciling Crown and Aboriginal inter-
 ests in Gitxsan territory (Gitxsan Treaty Team 2008,
 p. 3). Rather than identifying and allocating par-
 cels of land to be included in a treaty agreement, the
 Gitxsan argued that treaty making should focus on
 finding ways that the Gitxsan and the Crown could
 work together to share the use and governance of
 lands and resources across their larger traditional
 territories. This proposal rested on their asserted
 Aboriginal property rights (Gitxsan Treaty Team
 2008, p. 8):
 Our claim, and our only distinct claim, is to the
 inherited collective rights of our ancestors . . . All
 Canadians have the right to inherit property. So
 do we. Our inheritance is an interest in the land
 making up our traditional territories. That inter-
 est entitles us to a shared decision making in the
 development of that territory and a share of the
 wealth it generates . . . The detail of this is what
 we wish to negotiate.
 If provided with access to their ancestral lands, the
 Gitsxan argued, they would not require special fund-
 ing from the Crown, but would meet their economic
 needs through partnerships with provincial and fed-
 eral agencies and with private interests who seek
 to develop the valuable resources found in their
 territory.
 The Haida Nation asserts collective hereditary
 and Aboriginal title and rights to Haida Gwaii, an ar-
 chipelago off the north coast of British Columbia.
 While the Haida are engaged in the treaty process,
 they have not invested significant resources in the
 process and as of late 2012 remained at an early
 stage of negotiation. Over the past two decades the
 Haida have largely pursued their land interests out-
 side of the treaty process, including through litiga-
 tion, direct protest, and negotiation of non-treaty
 agreements with governments and private interests
 (Takeda and R0pke 2010). This strategy has yielded
 important advances for the Haida, including the cre-
 ation of co-management agreements with the federal
 government that give the Haida an important role in
 governing extensive terrestrial and marine ecosys-
 tems, including in Gwaii Haanas National Park and
 surrounding marine areas (Gill 2009; Canada and
 Haida Nation 2010).
 In 2009, these co-management agreements were
 bolstered by the signing of a "reconciliation proto-
 col" agreement between the Haida Nation and the
 government of British Columbia. In this agreement
 both parties committed themselves to seeking 'a
 more respectful approach to co-existence by way
 of land and natural resource management on Haida
 Gwaii through shared decision-making' (British
 Columbia and Haida Nation 2009, p. 1). The pro-
 tocol is described as 'an incremental step in a pro-
 cess of reconciliation of Haida and Crown titles' and
 the agreement is prefaced with an acknowledgement
 that the parties 'hold differing views with regard to
 sovereignty, title, ownership and jurisdiction over
 Haida Gwaii' (British Columbia and Haida Nation
 2009, p. 1). Despite fundamental disagreement
 about which party owns or has jurisdiction over
 Haida Gwaii, the Haida and the provincial Crown
 agreed to work together towards a set of common
 goals, such as the provision of socio-economic
 and ecological benefits, which are to be achieved
 through a process of shared decision-making.
 It is important to recognize that some progress
 has been made towards the restitution of Aboriginal
 land and resource rights in Canada over the past few
 decades. Major land claims agreements have been

 negotiated in the Canadian North (Usher 2003;
 Miller 2009), several modern treaties have been
 completed in British Columbia (McKee 2009), and
 federal and provincial governments have negotiated
 a range of co-management agreements with First
 Nations that provide the latter with a role in manag-
 ing their ancestral lands and resources (Notzke 1 995 ;
 Berkes 2009). In addition, the Crown is now required
 to consult with (and, in some cases, accommodate)
 First Nations when contemplating land and resource
 developments in areas where Aboriginal title and
 rights may exist (Isaac and Knox 2005) and this has
 triggered a greater role for Aboriginal peoples in
 such projects. Finally, in a small number of cases the
 Crown has negotiated revenue-sharing agreements
 with First Nations, which allow Aboriginal commu-
 nities to share in some of the economic benefits that
 accrue from land and resource development (British
 Columbia 2012). While these represent progress to-
 wards recognition of Aboriginal property rights and
 allow Aboriginal communities to benefit from the
 use of lands and resources in their ancestral territo-
 ries, these advances are partial, fragile, and applied
 inconsistently across the landscape (Coates and
 Poelzer 2010), falling well short of the kind of com-
 prehensive shared land and resource management
 models advocated by the Gitxsan Nation, the Haida
 Nation and the Hul'qumi'num Treaty Group.
 Conclusion: towards shared ownership
 The British Columbia treaty process was created to
 resolve a longstanding dispute between the Crown
 and Aboriginal peoples over ownership of land. For
 the Crown, treaties are seen as a way to transform
 Aboriginal title, a property claim it views as weakly
 defined and geographically amorphous, into property
 forms that mesh smoothly with the legal and politi-
 cal-economic structures of the settler state. Treaties
 produce treaty settlement lands, held by First Nations
 in fee simple title, and confirm all other lands as
 property of the Crown. The Crown insists that cer-
 tain forms of property, particularly lands already held
 in fee simple, be excluded from treaty negotiations
 and, more broadly, commits itself to minimizing the
 impact of treaty making on private interests in Crown
 lands, such as tenures to cut timber or extract water,
 and to compensating these interests when their rights
 are disrupted by treaty agreements. At the same time,
 the Crown is unwilling to compensate Aboriginal
 peoples for past disruption of their property rights,
 caused by privatization of their lands or extraction
 of resources from their territories, arguing that treaty
 talks are about establishing a new relationship be-
 tween the Crown and Aboriginal peoples rather than
 about dealing with the past.
 This reworking of property through treaty mak-
 ing involves a simultaneous reworking of British
 Columbia's geography. Under the current model,
 treaty making is focused on redrawing the line be-
 tween Aboriginal and settler spaces. Although this
 new line allows somewhat more space for Aboriginal
 peoples and properties, it requires that First Nations
 give up rights to lands and resources across their tradi-
 tional territories, except where these are specifically
 identified in the treaty. The result is the reproduction
 of the kind of colonial geography - a highly asym-
 metrical allocation of space - that Aboriginal peo-
 ples have long been struggling to overcome. This
 reworking of property and geography is underwrit-
 ten by the dominant Western conception of property,
 the ownership model, which relies on a particu-
 lar spatial form (the clearly bounded plot), on the
 idea that property is a fungible thing, and that em-
 phasizes the exclusive right of property holders. For
 the Crown, the institutionalization of this property
 model through treaty agreements that settle any and
 all claims to Aboriginal title once and for all time,
 provides the kind of certainty of land ownership that
 it desires. For many Aboriginal groups engaged in
 the treaty process, however, this model provides for
 an uncertain future. Few First Nations have been
 willing to sign on to this kind of lopsided property
 trade-off, which requires them to give up important
 connections to their traditional territories.
 The Chief Commissioner of the BC Treaty
 Commission recently called on the negotiating
 parties to provide a new direction for the faltering
 treaty process. I argue that this new direction can be
 found in the proposals for an alternative approach
 to treaty advanced by the Hul'qumi'num Treaty
 Group, the Gitxsan Nation and the Haida Nation,
 all of which draw on ideas important to Aboriginal
 property systems. These proposals reject the idea
 of dividing traditional territories into separate (and
 highly unequal) spaces of Aboriginal and settler
 property, and propose the organization of property
 rights on a more functional basis, with Aboriginal ti-
 tle overlapping with Crown title across the breadth
 of Aboriginal traditional territories. This need not
 mean that Aboriginal peoples own their traditional
 territories, in the Western sense of ownership, but
 rather that treaties allow for the ongoing exercise of
 those rights rather than their extinguishment.

 The current approach to treaty making also re-
 lies on the idea that land is fungible, a commod-
 ity that can be easily separated from the landholder
 and traded in the market. Shaped by the ownership
 model, the treaty process is based on the notion of
 one parcel of land being largely interchangeable
 with any other, and that this interchange is facili-
 tated by the market value of land. In treaty negoti-
 ations, Aboriginal groups must select one piece of
 land over another for inclusion as treaty settlement
 land, within the constraints of the Crown's financial
 mandate for that treaty table, and then relinquish
 claims to all other lands. As Edward John argues,
 this notion of land as a fungible property and that
 treaties will extinguish Aboriginal title, which em-
 bodies a more fundamental connection to the land, is
 anathema to many Aboriginal people. By obviating
 the need to extinguish Aboriginal title and rights, the
 alternative proposals discussed here recognize the
 need for Aboriginal peoples to maintain an ongoing
 connection to their traditional territories.
 Perhaps most fundamentally, these alternative
 models reject the exclusivity at the heart of the cur-
 rent treaty model, the idea that treaty must result in
 the production of separate and exclusive Aboriginal
 and Crown spaces and properties. Instead, they argue
 that treaties should be organized around principles
 of reciprocity and sharing - sharing space, sharing
 properties, sharing wealth - values close to the heart
 of many Aboriginal cultures. As Tully (2000) notes,
 Canada was founded on a profound act of sharing,
 with Aboriginal peoples sharing lands, resources, and
 ecological knowledge with European newcomers,
 and this mutual commitment to the principles of shar-
 ing and reciprocity was reflected in early treaty agree-
 ments. This commitment to sharing in treaty-making
 processes, and in relations between the Crown and
 Aboriginal peoples more broadly, was lost over
 time, as settlers became dominant and sought to in-
 corporate Aboriginal lands, resources and peoples
 into the settler state. By the late nineteenth century,
 the Crown saw treaties predominately as vehicles to
 take possession of Aboriginal lands and to eliminate
 Aboriginal peoples from the landscape, and any com-
 mitments on its part to sharing of lands and wealth
 with Aboriginal signatories often were lost or forgot-
 ten once treaties were in place.
 In British Columbia, historic treaties were
 largely absent as the Crown decided that it could
 simply take the land and relocate Aboriginal peo-
 ples to small Indian reserves. Over the past century
 and half, settlers and the settler state have enjoyed
 the lion's share of the wealth generated by the prov-
 ince's lands and resources, as Aboriginal commu-
 nities were largely excluded from the province's
 social, economic and political life. The alternatives
 discussed here point the way towards a more equal,
 respectful and productive relationship between the
 Crown and Aboriginal peoples, where lands and re-
 sources (and the benefits derived from them) are
 shared and where treaties are not so much about
 achieving full and final closure on questions to do
 with land and governance but rather about creating
 conditions for ongoing discussion and engagement
 on the full range of concerns that shape contempo-
 rary Crown- Aboriginal relations.
 Treaty making in British Columbia has reached
 an impasse. Few First Nations are willing to sign
 onto the kind of treaty deals on offer from the Crown.
 While the Crown has shown some flexibility in ad-
 dressing Aboriginal concerns about land and re-
 sources, it has not moved far enough to allay deep
 rooted Aboriginal concerns about loss of access to
 their ancestral territories. Further, at present there
 is no indication that the Crown is willing to under-
 take the kind of fundamental rethink of the existing
 treaty model that is called for by the Haida, Gitxsan
 or Hul'qumi'num proposals. Putting the principle of
 sharing at the heart of the treaty process, I believe,
 will provide the direction needed to move past the
 current impasse. In practical terms this means mov-
 ing towards treaties that embody ideas about shared
 Aboriginal-Crown titles and jurisdictions, and that
 institutionalize processes and structures for shared
 decision making and the sharing of wealth that flows
 from lands and natural resources. This approach
 would help the parties reach the overarching goals
 set out for the treaty process two decades ago, includ-
 ing reconciling conflicting interest in the land and es-
 tablishing a new relationship between the Crown and
 Aboriginal peoples based on 'mutual trust, respect
 and understanding' (British Columbia 1991, p. 8).
 More broadly, an emphasis on sharing ownership of
 the land, and of Aboriginal and non- Aboriginal peo-
 ples working together to use and govern the land, of-
 fers a hopeful model for bridging the deep divide
 between Aboriginal and settler societies.
 The difficulties of treaty making in British
 Columbia reflect broader challenges associated with
 restitution and reconciliation in settler colonies.
 More particularly, this study reaffirms property as a
 central site of contestation in settler colonial states,
 especially when it comes to processes of land resti-
 tution and efforts to reconcile competing Aboriginal

 and Crown claims to territory. As a key part of the
 structure of settler colonialism - that is, of the le-
 gal, political and economic framework that shapes
 life in settler colonies - dominant Western property
 conceptions and practices serve to constrain such
 processes narrowly within the bounds of the settler
 state. When it does occur, land restitution typically
 comes in the form of fee simple title, reproducing
 the spatially confined, fungible and exclusionary
 characteristics of the settler property regime, and
 there is little room for property proposals that do not
 fit into this dominant mould. Under these terms, land
 restitution may represent, at best, an important ef-
 fort to address past injustices, but hardly a signifi-
 cant break with the colonial past and present.

 Nisga'a in 1976 under its comprehensive claims process and
 the Nisga'a final treaty agreement was completed in 2000.
 Although negotiated outside of the formal British Columbia
 treaty process, in many ways the Nisga'a treaty has served as a
 template for all modern treaties negotiated in the province.

 Racial Discrimination (CERD) expressed concern about the
 lack of perceptible difference between the older extinguish-
 ment approach, which required Aboriginal peoples to 'cede,
 release and surrender' their broader Aboriginal title, and the
 'modification and release' approach which has replaced it (UN
 CERD 2007, para. 22).

 Notes
 1 .In this article, I use the terms Aboriginal peoples and First
 Nations interchangeably to refer to the peoples who inhabited
 what is now British Columbia prior to the arrival of settlers
 (peoples of European descent). The Crown refers collectively
 to the governments of Canada and British Columbia.
 2. Elsewhere, I have explored property issues in the British
 Columbia treaty process, though in a much less detailed and
 systematic fashion. In my case study of treaty making in
 Hul'qumi'num territory (Egan 2012), I focus on the challenges
 posed by extensive private land holdings to treaty settlement
 in that particular case. In a survey article on property, geogra-
 phy and Indigenous peoples in Canada (Egan and Place 2013),
 we discuss the centrality of property concerns to modern treaty
 making, matrimonial real property reform, and the privatiza-
 tion of landholdings within existing First Nations reserves.
 3. The meaning of such treaties, including the extent to which
 they extinguish of Aboriginal title and rights, is contested by
 Aboriginal groups. See, for example, Hildebrandt et al. (1996)
 and Venne (2007).
 4. In addition to the Douglas treaties on Vancouver Island, the
 northeastern portion of the province, including the lands ly-
 ing to the east of the continental divide, was included in the
 1899 settlement of Treaty 8, which extends into Alberta,
 Saskatchewan, and the Northwest Territories Fumoleau 2004).
 5. In Canada, Indian reserve lands are not actually owned by
 Aboriginal peoples; rather, under Section 91(24) of the British
 North America Act of 1867, these lands are held in trust by the
 Canadian government 'as lands reserved for Indians'.
 6. These First Nations were represented at the treaty table by
 the Carrier Sekáni Tribal Council. After more than a decade
 of negotiations, in 2007 the Tribal Council withdrew from the
 treaty process. As of late 2012, these eight Carrier Sekáni First
