 ABSTRACT. In 1905 and 1906, the Cree of the southwestern James Bay region signed Treaty No. 9 whereby they relinquished to the Canadian government their claim to the lands south of the Albany River (the northern boundary of the province of
 Ontario at the time). The official text of Treaty No. 9 made no mention of land submerged below water cover, and thus the Cree
 did not relinquish such regions at that time. By contrast, the Cree of the northwestern James Bay and southwestern Hudson Bay
 region who signed the 1929-30 Adhesions to Treaty No. 9 relinquished their claims to "land covered by water" for the area bounded on the south by the northerly limit of Treaty No. 9, as this clause was specifically included in the text of the adhesion.
 The issue of "land covered by water" is significant because the western James Bay region has been, and will continue to be,
 subject to sea level changes associated with ongoing adjustments due to the last ice age and modern global warming signals.
 In the absence of detailed maps, we used models of these processes, constrained by available geophysical and geodetic data
 sets, to retrodict shoreline changes and the rate of land emergence over the last two centuries within the boundaries specified
 by Treaty No. 9. We also project shoreline migration to the end of the 21st century within the same region. The rate of land emergence since 1905 in the area south of the Albany River is estimated as -3.0 km2/yr. Over the next century, land will
 continue to emerge in this region at a mean rate of -1.4 km2/yr. This emergent land should be a subject of consideration within any comprehensive land claim put forward by the Cree; in this regard, it will be interesting to see how the Canadian judicial system and the Comprehensive Claims Branch handle the novel issue of emergent land.

 RÉSUMÉ. En 1905 et 1906, les Cris du sud-ouest de la région de la baie James ont signé le Traité n° 9, par le biais duquel ils ont cédé au gouvernement du Canada leur droit de revendication des terres au sud de la rivière Albany (la limite nord de la province de l'Ontario à l'époque). Le texte officiel du Traité n° 9 ne faisait aucune mention des terres submergées sous l'eau,
 si bien que les Cris n'ont pas renoncé à ces régions à ce moment-là. En revanche, les Cris du nord-ouest de la baie James et
 du sud-ouest de la baie d'Hudson qui ont signé les adhésions au Traité n° 9 (1929-1930) ont renoncé à leurs revendications
 aux « terres recouvertes d'eau » dans la zone délimitée au sud par la limite nord du Traité n° 9, puisque cette clause était
 expressément incluse dans le texte de l'adhésion. La question des « terres recouvertes d'eau » est importante parce que l'ouest
 de la région de la baie James a été et continuera d'être assujettie aux variations du niveau de la mer liées aux ajustements
 continus découlant de la dernière période glaciaire et des récents signes de réchauffement planétaire. En l'absence de cartes
 détaillées, nous avons utilisé des modèles de ces processus, limités par les ensembles de données géophysiques et géodésiques
 disponibles, pour déterminer de façon rétrospective les changements du littoral et le taux d'émergence des terres au cours
 des deux derniers siècles dans les limites précisées dans le Traité n° 9. Nous faisons également une projection de la migration
 du littoral jusqu'à la fin du XXIe siècle dans cette même région. Le taux d'émergence des terres depuis 1905 dans la région
 au sud de la rivière Albany est estimé à -3,0 km2/année. Au cours du prochain siècle, les terres continueront d'émerger dans
 cette région au taux moyen de -1,4 km2/année. Ces terres émergées devraient être prises en compte dans toute revendication territoriale globale présentée par les Cris. À cet égard, il sera intéressant de voir comment le système judiciaire canadien et la Direction générale des revendications globales traiteront cette nouvelle question des terres émergées.

 INTRODUCTION
 At confederation in 1867, the Province of Canada was
 divided into the provinces of Ontario and Quebec; these
 two provinces, along with New Brunswick and Nova Sco-
 tia, formed the Dominion of Canada (Dean, 1969; Archives
 of Ontario, 2008; Fig. la). In 1870, an Imperial (British)
 Order-in-Council confirmed the acquisition and admittance
 of Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory into the
 Dominion of Canada (Rupert's Land and North-Western
 Territory - Enactment No. 3, 1870), as the British North
 America Act (1867) had made provisions for this eventual-
 ity. The landmass of Ontario at confederation was smaller
 than present-day Ontario, and in 1874 the Ontarian bounda-
 ries were provisionally moved west and north to increase
 its size (Dean, 1969; Archives of Ontario, 2008; Fig. lb). In
 1889, the Albany River became the northern boundary of
 Ontario (Dean, 1969; Archives of Ontario, 2008; Fig. lc).
 As this northern extension was acquired at the expense of
 the District of Keewatin, Northwest Territories (formerly
 Rupert's Land and North-Western Territory) - and this land
 had not been surrendered by treaty - a treaty with the Indi-
 ans who occupied this area would be required in the near
 future. Treaties between the Indians and the Dominion
 of Canada were required because the British Crown rec-
 ognized Indian land rights in North America (The Royal
 Proclamation of 1763; Henry, 2006).
 In 1905, a field team consisting of commissioners from
 both Ontario (Daniel G. MacMartin) and the Canadian
 government (Duncan C. Scott and Samuel Stewart) was
 assembled and entrusted with the task of traveling down
 the Albany River and entering into a treaty (Treaty No. 9,
 1905-06) with Indian groups occupying the region south of
 the Albany River (Scott et al., 1905). As not all the Indian
 groups south of the Albany River agreed to enter into
 Treaty No. 9 in 1905, a second trip was required in 1906.
 The text of Treaty No. 9 (1905-06) specified the lands to
 which the Indians relinquished claim by signing the treaty,
 as follows:
 the said Indians [Cree, Ojibwa and others] do hereby
 cede, release, surrender and yield up to the government
 of the Dominion of Canada, for His Majesty the King
 and His successors for ever, all their rights titles and
 privileges whatsoever, to the lands included within the
 following limits, that is to say: That portion or tract of
 land lying and being in the province of Ontario, bounded
 on the south by the height of land and the northern
 boundaries of the territory ceded by the Robinson-
 Superior Treaty of 1850, and the Robinson-Huron
 Treaty of 1850, and bounded on the east and north by the
 boundaries of the said province of Ontario as defined by
 law, and on the west by a part of the eastern boundary of
 the territory ceded by the Northwest Angle Treaty No.
 3; the said land containing an area of ninety thousand
 square miles, more or less.
 A "blanket" land clause that was standard procedure for
 most of the previous numbered treaties (e.g., Treaty No. 4,
 1874; Treaty No. 8, 1899) was also included in Treaty No. 9.
 This land clause read as follows:
 And also, the said Indian rights, titles and privileges
 whatsoever to all other lands wherever situated in
 Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba, the District of Keewatin, or
 in any other portion of the Dominion of Canada.
 It should be emphasized that no mention was made of
 "land covered by water" in the official text of Treaty No. 9
 and that the Canadian government recognizes that only the
 text in any treaty is binding (but see Macklem, 1997 and Long, 1993):
 the Government [of Canada] cannot admit [the Indians']
 claim to any thing which is not set forth in the treaty
 [with specific reference to Treaties 1 and 2]... which
 treaty is binding alike upon the Government and upon
 the Indians....
 (Honourable Privy Council, 1875)
 By contrast, the Adhesions to Treaty No. 9 (1931) were
 signed by "Indians" who lived in the area north of the
 Albany River (see Fig. 2a); this agreement included a "land
 covered by water" clause:
 [the said Indians residing north of the area included
 in Treaty No. 9] do hereby cede, release, surrender
 and yield up to the Government of the Dominion of
 Canada for His Majesty the King and His Successors
 forever, all our rights, titles and privileges whatsoever
 in all that tract of land, and land covered by water in
 the Province of Ontario, comprising part of the District
 of Kenora (Patricia Portion) containing one hundred
 and twenty-eight thousand three hundred and twenty
 square miles, more or less, being bounded on the South
 by the Northerly limit of Treaty Number Nine; on the
 West by Easterly limits of Treaties Numbers Three
 and Five, and the boundary between the Provinces of
 Ontario and Manitoba; on the North by the waters of
 Hudson Bay, and on the East by the waters of James
 Bay and including all islands, islets and rocks, waters
 and land covered by water [our emphasis] within the
 said limits, and also all the said Indian rights, titles
 and privileges whatsoever to all other lands and lands
 covered by water [our emphasis], wherever situated in
 the Dominion of Canada.
 (Adhesions to Treaty No. 9, 1931)
 Although the importance of the absence of a "land
 covered by water" clause in Treaty No. 9 has been recog-
 nized by the regional tribal organization, Nishnawbe-Aski
 Nation, which includes the First Nations of Treaty No. 9
 (the western James Bay Cree) (Hookimaw-Witt, 1997), a
 formal legal case has yet to be filed (Comprehensive Claims

 The earth is currently in an interglacial period, yet the
 James Bay region is subject to ongoing adjustment in con-
 sequence of the ice age that ended about 8000 years ago.
 Specifically, this region, which was once covered by an ice
 sheet that reached a thickness of 3-4 km at the peak of the
 last glacial cycle, is currently experiencing a postglacial
 rebound of the solid crust at rates of approximately 1 cm/yr
 (Mitrovica et al., 2000). This postglacial rebound gives rise
 to a land emergence, or alternatively a sea level fall, that
 is accompanied by shoreline migration. This migration has
 been active since the region became ice-free and is respon-
 sible for the raised late Holocene beach terraces that per-
 vade the region (Martini, 1981a). In addition to this ongoing
 ice age signal, the region has also been subject, over the last
 century, to sea level changes associated with global warm-
 ing. There is general consensus of a globally averaged rise
 due to global warming of approximately 1-2 mm/yr over
 this period (Church and White, 2011), but this sea level
 variation was highly variable geographically (Milne et al.,
 2009; Slangen et al., 2012).
 In an earlier paper (Tsuji et al., 2009), sea level changes
 in the James Bay region over the next millennium were
 predicted using a combination of numerical models of the
 ongoing sea level change due to the ice age and projections
 of the future global warming signal appearing in the Fourth
 Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on

 102 • L.J.S. TSUJI et al.
 Climate Change (IPCC, 2007). Our goal in that paper was
 to investigate possible future development of land bridges
 connecting current islands in James Bay with the main-
 land. In the present paper, we turn our attention to sea level
 changes over the last two centuries and during the next cen-
 tury. In particular, we retrodict past shoreline locations in
 the western James Bay area based on boundaries specified
 by Treaty No. 9 (1905-06) to determine the rate of land
 emergence (i.e., the appearance of land formerly covered
 by water) since 1905 and from the present to the end of the
 21st century. We also estimate the migration of shorelines
 in western James Bay during the century prior to 1905. No
 significant global change signal was active over this period,
 and thus the estimate provides a baseline for understand-
 ing the impact of global warming on land emergence dur-
 ing the 20th and 21st centuries. Our calculations are based
 on a numerical model of the ice age process, calibrated to fit
 geological and geodetic data sets, and a regional signal due
 to global warming.
 METHODS
 Computing the response of the earth to the late Pleisto-
 cene glacial cycles (glacial isostatic adjustment; henceforth
 GIA) requires models of both the space-time history of the
 ice cover and the viscoelastic structure of the earth. In this
 paper we adopt a modified form of the ICE-5G ice history
 (see below) and the VM2 viscosity model (Peltier, 2004).
 The VM2 model is characterized by an elastic lithosphere
 -90 km thick, and a mantle viscosity that increases from
 ~5 X 1020 Pa s in the upper mantle to ~2-3 x 1021 Pa s in the
 deep mantle. The ICE-5G and VM2 models are coupled in
 the sense that they have been derived together by iteratively
 improving both models to yield fits to globally distributed
 Late Holocene sea level data. While each of the models has
 significant uncertainty, their combination is constrained to
 fit these relative sea level histories. It would not be expected
 that the combined ICE-5G/VM2 model would provide
 an optimal fit to data at all locations. In the next section,
 we fine-tune the ice-history component of the combined
 model so that predictions based upon it are consistent with
 radial crustal deformation rates in the James Bay region as
 measured through surveying with the Global Positioning
 System. With this combined ice-earth model in hand, we
 calculate changes in topography (or sea level) since the Last
 Interglacial (-120 kyr ago). This calculation is based on a
 gravitationally self-consistent postglacial sea level theory
 that accounts for the deformational, gravitational, and rota-
 tional effects of the changing ice + water load (Kendall et
 al., 2005).
 A regional sea level signal associated with global
 warming is next added to the computed ice age signal. In this
 study, in order to sample a broad range of global warming
 signals, we present results from 1800 to the end of the 21st
 century. For the period 1800-1905, we assume that there is
 no global change signal. A probabilistic (Kaiman smoother)
 analysis of a widely distributed network of tide gauge records
 has estimated globally averaged sea level change across the
 20th century due to global warming (Hay et al., 2015). We
 have used the full reconstruction of sea level generated from
 this recent analysis to estimate the mean rate of sea level
 change within the James Bay region from 1905 to 1990.
 This value, 1.57 ± 0.28 mm/yr (95% confidence interval),
 accounts for the net signal due to recent ice volume changes,
 dynamic ocean variability, and thermosteric effects. (See
 Gough, 1998, for a discussion of the thermosteric signal in
 the James Bay and Hudson Bay regions.) Finally, for the
 period from 1990 to the end of the current century, we adopt
 two estimates of projected global mean sea level change -
 RCP2.6 (4.5 mm/yr) and RCP8.5 (8 mm/yr) - cited in the
 5th Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on
 Climate Change (Church et al., 2013: Section 13.8).
 Finally, the total sea level change associated with the ice
 age and modern global warming signals are combined with
 a dataset of present-day topography in order to track past
 changes in topography. For this purpose, we used present-
 day topography fields for James Bay from the Canadian
 Digital Elevation Model 0.75 arc second grid (NRC, 2013).
 Shorelines were defined as the contour of zero topography
 (i.e., locations where the sea surface and the crust were
 equal in height), and so their migration was tracked once
 the time history of topography was established. Changes in
 shoreline geometry since 1905, and in particular the areal
 extent covered by the associated land emergence over the
 area covered by Treaty No. 9 (1905-06; See Fig. 2), will be
 the focus of our calculations and discussions below.
 RESULTS
 Figure 3 shows estimates of the present day rate change of crustal elevation, with uncertainty, determi by GPS surveys at a suite of sites in the James Bay reg (Canadian Base Network [NRC, 2003]; black dots), as w as predictions based on the ICE-5G/VM2 model of the G process (blue dots). The location of the sites is shown in th inset. While the model accurately predicts the geograp variability in the crustal uplift signal, it overestimates  magnitude of the ice age signal. We applied a series of u form scalings to the ICE-5G ice thickness history in  James Bay region and found, accounting for errors in  GPS estimates, that a scaling of 0.93 yields a best RMS fit  the GPS rates (green dots). We adopt this modified vers of the ICE-5G model in our predictions of the ongoing level change due to GIA. We note that this modified G model still overestimates the crustal uplift rate at Mooson (site 1), the site closest to our region of interest, by -10% is therefore possible that in the analysis below we overest mate the ongoing sea level change due to the ice age by same amount. However, given the possibility of error in t individual GPS rates, we believe that the choice of scal should be based on the set of all James Bay GPS observ tions, rather than the estimated uplift rate at a specific sit

Predicted present-day rates of crustal uplift due to the ice age at sites in the James Bay region (see inset; box outlines region shown with observational constraints obtained from GPS surveying (Canadian Base Network [NRC, 2003]; black dots). Blue dots show predic VM2 model of GIA (Peltier, 2004), while green dots show a prediction in which ice thicknesses in the James Bay region over the last g by a factor of 0.93 (see text). The time period we consider in this article (1800-2100) is sufficiently short that the predicted rates of up assumed constant.
 Figure 4 shows the present day rate of change of sea level
 over the James Bay region associated with ongoing adjust-
 ment due to the ice age, computed using our GIA model.
 The sea level change in this area is dominated by post-
 glacial uplift of the crust at a rate of ~1 cm/yr (Fig. 3; see
 also Gough and Robinson, 2000), and the result is a broad,
 cumulative sea level fall of ~1 m per century. Thus, ice age
 effects dominate the sea level rise induced over the region
 by global warming during our period of interest, although
 the magnitude of 21st century sea level rise estimated in the
 RCP8.5 projection (8.0 mm/yr) is comparable in magnitude.
 We note that a tide gauge record at Churchill, Manitoba, has
 a mean rate of ~12 mm/yr from 1940 to 1990 (Tushingham,
 1992; Gough and Robinson, 2000), which is consistent with
 the sum of the ice age signal in Figure 4 (10.2 mm/yr) and
 the regional global change signal noted above (1.57 mm/yr).
 As an illustration of the results, Figure 5 shows the geo-
 graphic extent of land that has emerged in the James Bay
 region since 1800, computed by combining the ice age pre-
 diction with the global warming signal discussed above
 (0 mm/yr for 1800-1905 and 1.2 mm/yr from 1905 to pre-
 sent). Over this time period, land emergence took place at
 nearly all sites along the James Bay shoreline, with partic-
 ularly significant shoreline migration at the mouths of the
 Albany, Moose, and Harricana Rivers. For the region cov-
 ered by Treaty No. 9 (1905-06), which is bounded on the

 that the rate of predicted sea level change due to GIA may be assumed to be constant.
 north by the Albany River, on the west and south by the
 shoreline of James Bay, and on the east by the Ontario-
 Quebec border (Fig. 2), we predicted the total rate of land
 emergence for three time periods. For 1800-1905, the rate
 is 3.6 km2/yr; for 1905-2014, 3.0 ± 0.1 km2/yr (95% con-
 fidence interval); and for 2014-2100, 2.0 km2/yr using the
 RCP2.6 sea level projection, or 0.8 km2/yr using the RCP8.5
 projection. Thus, the total land emergence we retrodict for
 1905-2014 is 331 ± 12 km2 (95% confidence interval), and
 we project that 70-170 km2 of land will emerge over the
 period 2014-2100.
 DISCUSSION
 Extensive tracts of land south of the Albany River ha emerged over the last 110 years. Our geophysical model ice age dynamics is subject to some uncertainty, althou the results in Figure 3 indicate that our GIA model yie predictions that are consistent to a level of 10% with avail able GPS estimates of crustal uplift rates in the James B region. Geomorphological and hydrological phenom also introduce some uncertainty regarding the areal ext of emergent land. For example, sedimentary processes tend to add material to the western James Bay shoreline (Marti

 and Glooschenko, 1983-84 lifting of ice blocks during t sediments, and ice-walled channels canalize tidal cur-
 rents and erode mud flats (Martini, 1981b). Moreover, long-
 term variability in runoff into James Bay and Hudson Bay,
 as well as in groundwater discharge, will impact regional
 trends in sea level (Gough et al., 2005). Nevertheless,
 land emergence in Hudson Bay and James Bay is a well-
 studied geophysical phenomenon (Walcott, 1972), and it is
 well documented in the indigenous knowledge of the western
 James Bay region (McDonald et al., 1997). Indeed, the rates
 of emergence are sufficient that observations of the ongoing
 phenomenon are common amongst First Nations people of
 the region (e.g., former Deputy Chief Charlie Cheechoo of
 the Moose Cree First Nation, pers. comm. 2008).
 Given the extent of emergent land in southern James Bay
 over the past century, the continued land emergence over
 the next century and beyond, and the well-documented
 mineral wealth in the region (AMEC, 2004; Koven, 2007;
 Larmour, 2007), the economic implications associated with
 disputes over land rights are substantial. The First Nations
 of the western James Bay region are not opposed to con-
 trolled resource development per se, but they have argued
 that development should take place within a framework in
 which the First Nations people also benefit (Chief Andrew
 Solomon of Fort Albany First Nation, pers. comm. 2009).
 The well-being of the Cree is also closely tied to that of the
 environment (Hookimaw-Witt, 1997), and therefore land
 issues in the western James Bay region are of great impor-
 tance beyond the monetary. Since "land covered by water"
 (i.e., emergent land) was never surrendered through the
 signing of Treaty No. 9 (1905-06) for the land south of the
 Albany River, the western James Bay Cree will likely be
 submitting a land claim that specifically treats the issue of
 emergent land (Chief Andrew Solomon of Fort Albany First
 Nation, pers. comm. 2009).
 We are unaware of any treaty land claims based on the
 issue of emergent land and believe this is a new area of
 endeavour with respect to land claims in Canada. In Can-
 ada, there exists the common law concept of Aboriginal
 rights and title; existing Aboriginal rights were affirmed
 in the Canadian Constitution Act (1982) under section
 35 (1) (INAC, 1993). In addition, the Supreme Court of
 Canada's Calder decision in 1973 acknowledged the exist-
 ence of Aboriginal title in Canadian law (Hurley, 2000),
 resulting in the first policy statement on land claims (INAC,
 1993; Comprehensive Claims Branch, 2007). Canadian
 policy divides land claims into two basic categories: com-
 prehensive and specific. Comprehensive claims are based
 on the assertion that Aboriginal rights and title to land and

 106 • L.J.S. TSUJI et al.
 resources were never relinquished through treaty or other
 legal means, while specific claims refer to alleged misad-
 ministration of Indian assets or the non-fulfillment of gov-
 ernment responsibilities related to treaties (INAC, 1993;
 Comprehensive Claims Branch, 2007). Clearly, emergent
 land would fall under the comprehensive land claim cate-
 gory since this type of land was not considered in Treaty
 No. 9 (1905-06).
 The primary purpose of the comprehensive claim pro-
 cess is to reach a negotiated agreement (i.e., a modern
 treaty) whereby undefined rights of Aboriginal peoples
 are exchanged for a specifically defined package of rights
 and benefits (including lands and resources) that is consti-
 tutionally protected (INAC, 1993; Comprehensive Claims
 Branch, 2007). Thus, it is unclear how the Canadian judicial
 system and the Comprehensive Claims Branch will handle
 the novel issue of emergent land in the western James Bay
 region, with respect to Treaty No. 9. In this regard, the pre-
 dictions described herein may serve as scientific input into
 any upcoming negotiations. More generally, these predic-
 tions emphasize that environmental change, whether natu-
 ral (i.e., ongoing ice age effects) or anthropogenic in origin
 (global warming), are realities that should inform discus-
 sions between First Nations people, the government, and
 the general public.
