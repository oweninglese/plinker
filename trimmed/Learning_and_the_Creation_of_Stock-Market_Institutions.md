 COMMENTARY
 Multiculturalism and the
 Aboriginal Peoples in Canada
 H SRIKANTH
 The challenges posed by ethnic
 minorities have compelled
 many a modern state to accept
 multiculturalism as state policy.
 Canada's contributions to
 development of the theory and
 practice of multiculturalism are
 well known. However, within
 Canada itself there are segments
 like the aboriginal peoples who
 consider that multiculturalism
 does not adequately address
 their problems, experiences and
 concerns. Looking at different
 trajectories that have shaped
 Canadian multiculturalism,
 this article throws light on
 the aboriginal critique of
 multiculturalism and shows how
 the indigenous peoples of Canada
 have been shaping their own
 future outside the framework
 of multiculturalism.
 The first draft of the article was submitted
 to the International Conference on
 "Multiculturalism and Its Discontent:
 Canada and India", organised by the Indian
 Association for Canadian Studies at Jodhpur
 on 29-31 January 2012.
 H Srikanth (hskant@gmail.com) is with the
 department of political science, North-Eastern
 Hill University, Shillong.
 Of late, there has been a growing recognition that almost all mod
 ern states are, in fact, multi
 cultural, multi-ethnic and multi-nation
 states. Earlier in many a country, the
 dominant nations which held state power
 followed the policy of assimilation and
 attempted to homogenise the minorities
 - the tribals and indigenous peoples,
 linguistic and religious minorities, and
 smaller ethnic groups/nations, by im
 posing a dominant national culture, lan
 guage and religion. But with different
 minorities asserting their autonomy and
 identity, modern states have realised the
 limitations of the "melting pot" theory.
 Increasing opposition to assimilation,
 movements for cultural identity and social
 justice and struggles for political auto
 nomy/independence have compelled the
 modern states - western as well as non
 western - to respond to the challenges by
 devising strategies that accommodate
 the minorities' quest for identity and
 autonomy within the ambit of the nation
 state. Multiculturalism is one such con
 scious intervention espoused to deal with
 the challenges of growing diversities.
 The Canadian Model
 Canada was the first country in the
 world to declare multiculturalism as its
 official policy. The Canadian policy of
 multiculturalism intends to eliminate
 racism and discrimination in all walks of
 life and guarantee to the minorities the
 right to maintain and promote their cul
 tural identities. In pursuit of the objec
 tives, a multicultural directorate was
 constituted in Canada as early as in 1971.
 Later, a ministry of multiculturalism was
 created in 1972 to implement and monitor
 activities in pursuit of multiculturalism.
 The Canadian Charter of Human Rights
 and Freedoms (1985) and the Employ
 ment Equity Act (1986) also acknowl
 edged multicultural principles. The multi
 cultural policy received a further boost
 with the passage of the Multiculturalism
 Act in 1987. The Act, which provides
 a legal framework to guide federal
 responsibilities and activities, makes it
 obligatory for the Canadian government
 to work for preserving, enhancing and
 sharing the multicultural heritage of
 Canada by eliminating barriers in par
 ticipation of all individuals and commu
 nities in public life. The Act talks of the
 need to make all social, cultural, economic
 and political institutions of Canada to be
 both respectful and inclusive of Canada's
 multicultural character. Several policies,
 programmes and services are initiated
 at different levels to assist the socio
 economic integration of individuals and
 communities and promote intercultural
 understanding through public education
 and outreach initiatives.1
 The policy of multiculturalism has
 helped Canada in so many ways. Apart
 from reducing ethnic tensions within
 Canada, the practice of multiculturalism
 gave a special identity to Canada at the
 global level. Canadian governments
 have effectively used multiculturalism
 to promote Canadian political and busi
 ness interests abroad. Inspired by the
 Canadian model, other countries like
 Australia, the United States (us), Britain
 and different developing countries have
 also started endorsing multicultural
 policies. Multiculturalism has gained
 considerable support among policy
 makers, liberal intellectuals and social
 activists. It is now viewed as the most
 democratic and humane way of han
 dling the issues of different kinds of
 minorities, like immigrants, aboriginal
 and indigenous peoples, linguistic and
 religious minorities, etc.
 The growing popularity of the theory
 and practice of multiculturalism should
 not, however, make one lose sight of its
 discontents. The conservative critics who
 disparage multiculturalism for dividing
 the people and weakening the states are
 well known.2 But powerful internal criti
 cism of multiculturalism by those who
 are supposed to be the beneficiaries of
 official multicultural policies has not
 received adequate public attention. The
 aboriginal people are one such commu
 nity which has found multiculturalism
 irrelevant to its interests and concerns.

 COMMENTARY
 Although the Multiculturalism Act for
 mally acknowledges the rights of abo
 riginal people in Canada, the First Nations
 (Native Canadians/Americans) and the
 Inuit disassociated themselves from the
 multiculturalism enunciated by the
 Canadian state. This article attempts to
 appreciate the substance and rationale
 of their critique of multiculturalism and
 examines their struggles to uphold abo
 riginal identities and interests.
 Historical Trajectories
 Canada has always been a multicultural,
 multi-ethnic and multinational country
 in the sense that there were different
 cultural, ethnic and national communities
 in Canada ever since it came into existence
 in 1867. But being multicultural and
 following multiculturalism are not the
 same. Canada started following multi
 culturalism as an official policy only from
 the 1970s onwards. Prior to that, for over
 a century, Canada tried to assimilate the
 cultural and ethnic minorities by impos
 ing Anglo-Saxon values and practices. A
 clear grasp of the history of the first hun
 dred years of Canada's existence is
 therefore necessary to understand the
 compulsions that forced the Canadian
 state to opt for multiculturalism.
 Canadian multiculturalism has been
 influenced by three autonomous, but
 intersecting historical trajectories. The
 first significant historical trajectory was
 obviously the history of Quebec's quest
 for identity and autonomy. As is well
 known, Quebec is a Francophone domi
 nant province of Canada. Once a part of
 New France, it was ceded to the British
 in 1763, following the Treaty of Paris.
 Between 1763 and 1867 this ceded terri
 tory, initially named as the province of
 Quebec, was bifurcated into Lower
 Canada and Upper Canada, only to be
 merged again to form the province of
 Canada in 1840.
 Factors like attempts to assimilate its
 French inhabitants into the English
 mainstream, increasing migration of the
 British loyalists into the province, and
 the irreconcilable cultural differences
 between English and French speaking
 people necessitated alternative political
 arrangements in the United Province of
 Canada. It was at about this period that
 the British North American colonies,
 compelled by the threat of American oc
 cupation, started exploring the possibil
 ity of coming together to form a federa
 tion. Although about 40% of the French
 in the United Province of Canada were
 then reluctant to join the Canadian fed
 eration, political realism compelled the
 elites of French Canada to lend support
 to the formation of a federation in antici
 pation of provincial autonomy to the
 Francophone dominated province.
 The Constitution Act of 1867, also
 known as the British North America Act,
 responded positively to the concerns of
 the Francophone and divided the prov
 ince of Canada into Ontario and Quebec.
 Subsequently, both Ontario and Quebec
 joined other provinces to form the Domin
 ion of Canada.3 Special provisions were
 included in the Constitution Act, reas
 suring Quebec's concerns regarding reli
 gion, culture and civic laws.4 Quebec
 was guaranteed a fixed number of repre
 sentatives to the senate and both English
 and French were declared as official lan
 guages of Canada (Denis 1990:156-59).
 Despite such concessions, tensions be
 tween the province of Quebec and the
 rest of Canada continued in one form or
 the other. There was constant pressure
 from the French nationalists who advocat
 ed Quebec's secession from Canada. The
 Canadian government sought to make
 concessions to accommodate the Quebe
 cois by constituting the Royal Commis
 sion on Bilingualism and Biculturalism
 in 1960s and concluding the Meech Lake
 Accord in 1980s.5 These two interven
 tions, conceived primarily to attend to
 the needs of the French Canadians, did,
 in fact, effect two landmark decisions in
 the history of Canada - the first one led
 to the formal declaration of Multicultural
 Policy in 1971 and the latter to the prom
 ulgation of Multiculturalism Act in 1987.
 The changing demographic compo
 sition of Canada is the second important
 historical trajectory that influenced
 Canada to accept multiculturalism. Post
 second world war Canada can no more be
 viewed as a binational state. Apart from
 the English and the French speaking
 people, Canada is inhabited by several oth
 er immigrant ethnic communities. There
 has been a steady flow of immigrants to
 Canada from different parts of the
 globe, initially from Europe and then
 from different developing countries. Till
 the 1950s the preference was for immi
 gration from Europe. Concessions were
 given to white immigrants who wish to
 settle down as agriculturalists.
 The situation was not so favourable
 for Chinese and other coloured immi
 grants who were employed as semi
 skilled and unskilled labourers. They
 experienced several hardships and racial
 discrimination for decades. During the
 period between the first and the second
 world wars, even immigrants from the
 southern and eastern Europe were dis
 criminated on the grounds of nationality
 and ethnicity. However, after the second
 world war, the economic situation began
 to improve in Canada. Because of the
 stagnation in birth rate of white Canadian
 population and fall in immigration from
 Europe, Canada had to liberalise its
 immigration policy in the 1960s in its
 own economic interest. Accordingly, giv
 ing up the racial and ethnic bias, the
 Canadian government came out with a
 point system in 1967 and opened up im
 migration opportunities for people from
 developing countries.6
 Consequently, the immigrant popula
 tion from non-European countries, who
 were officially recognised as "visible eth
 nic minorities", began to increase con
 siderably. The 2006 Census showed that
 people from more than 200 ethnic ori
 gins have made Canada their home. Sta
 tistics Canada predicts that by 2031, be
 tween 25% and 28% of Canada's popula
 tion will be foreign born, and between
 29% and 32% will belong to a visible mi
 nority group. It also projects that by 2031,
 non-Christian religious communities
 will represent approximately 14% of
 Canada's total population.7 Given the
 growing ethnic and racial diversities,
 there was every possibility of an outbreak
 of ethnic tensions in Canada, as in other
 western countries. The Canadian state had
 to pre-empt such possibilities. Further, it
 was realised that the ethnic immigrants
 can contribute positively to the Canadian
 economy, if only they felt secure in the
 alien land and were treated as equals
 with others. More so, it is understood
 that the ethnic immigrants who come to

 COMMENTARY
 Canada in search of greener pastures con
 tinue to cling to their cultural roots. There
 is no way that these immigrants could be
 assimilated forcibly into the dominant
 national culture(s) of Canada. Apart from
 the internal factors, Canada had to respond
 to the changing international scenario
 that followed the success of anti-colonial
 struggles and the birth of new states.
 The number of sovereign countries un
 der non-white leaders has increased sub
 stantially in the United Nations and in the
 Commonwealth. Subsequent to decoloni
 sation different international covenants
 on human rights were approved during
 this period. The racist approach in the
 changed conditions is unviable and even
 reactionary. Given these realities, in its
 own interests, Canada was to follow multi
 culturalism that accepts diversities and
 looks at them not as a drawback, but as
 assets to be harnessed to make rich the
 cultural heritage of Canada.
 The third trajectory that influenced
 multiculturalism in Canada was the rise
 of aboriginal movements. Looking at the
 English and the French as founding
 nations tends to ignore the historical
 fact that prior to European colonisation,
 North America was inhabited by several
 indigenous aboriginal communities. The
 colonial settlers built modern states in
 Americas by defeating, displacing and
 subjugating the aboriginal communities.
 Canada was no exception. The indigenous
 aboriginal communities, who at the time
 of contact were recognised by the British
 empire as "sovereign nations", lost their
 lands and their independence to the
 colonial settlers.
 The advent of Canada did not bring any
 qualitative change to the aboriginal peo
 ples, who became the wards of the federal
 government of Canada and were confined
 mosdy to reserves. Despite its commitment
 to liberal democracy, Canada denied
 equal citizenship to the indigenous abo
 riginal communities until 1950. Conscious
 attempts were made to deface aboriginal
 identities and assimilate the aboriginal
 communities through residential schools
 and religious conversions. Against the
 centuries of oppression and discrimina
 tion, the indigenous peoples began to or
 ganise themselves into different associa
 tions to fight for their aboriginal rights.
 Their movements did in a way influence
 the policy of multiculturalism in Canada.
 When the Canadian government talks
 of ensuring security, equal opportunities
 and identities of all racial and ethnic
 communities, it meant not only the "visi
 ble immigrant minorities", but also the
 aboriginal population. The Multicultural
 ism Act, in fact, does talk of the need to
 acknowledge aboriginal rights. Some of
 the activities taken up under multicul
 tural programme involve the aboriginal
 peoples also. The Canadian government
 would be more than happy had the na
 tive peoples accepted the state multicul
 tural policies. But for certain compelling
 reasons, the aboriginal peoples of Canada
 refused to be covered under the Canadian
 multicultural policy.
 Aboriginal People's Response
 The aboriginal response to multicultur
 alism differs from country to country.
 The aboriginal people in Australia disas
 sociated themselves from multicultural
 ism. The native activists and their sup
 porters in Australia view the philosophy
 and politics of multiculturalism as a
 threat to the interests of the indigenous
 peoples.8 In some Latin American coun
 tries the aboriginal people made use of
 multicultural policies to promote their
 interests.9 Canada finds itself between
 the two extremes. The aboriginal peo
 ples of Canada were not so open in their
 rejection of multiculturalism like their
 counterparts in Australia, but they did
 make it clear that they do not own multi
 culturalism as their programme.
 The federal government of Canada,
 despite occasional reference to aborigi
 nal peoples in their documents on multi
 culturalism, emphasises more what it calls
 "ethnic visible minorities", officially mea
 ning non-white, non-European immi
 grants. Naturally, the aboriginal people
 in Canada decline to identify themselves
 as minority ethnic groups and refuse to
 become a part of the mosaic that the
 state multiculturalism seeks to build. In
 their view, multiculturalism has more to
 do with the interests of the immigrant eth
 nic communities than the interests and
 concerns of the indigenous people.10
 They argue that unlike immigrant mino
 rities, who came to Canada in search of
 greener pastures, the aboriginal peoples
 are the original/first settlers who lived
 in the continent prior to European coloni
 sation. In their view, the dominant focus
 of multiculturalism overlooks the histo
 ry of European invasions and the coloni
 al subjugation of the First Peoples.
 The deprivations and subjugations
 that the indigenous peoples have experi
 enced under colonial powers are not expe
 rienced by any other minorities in the
 country. Naturally, their concerns and
 demands are very different from those of
 ethnic immigrant minorities. The guar
 antee of formal equality and granting of
 citizenship rights do not satisfy aborigi
 nal people. The natives assert their right
 to self-determination and seek recogni
 tion of their identity as aboriginal peo
 ples - as First Nations, as Inuit and as
 Metis. They claim ancestral title over
 large tracks of land and natural resourc
 es forcibly taken over by the colonial/
 Canadian governments representing the
 settlers' interests (Sanders 1985:292-303).
 Aboriginal perceptions and claims at
 times contradict liberal democratic tenets
 of individualism, freedom and rule of
 law. The state-sponsored multiculturalism
 finds few takers among the indigenous
 peoples. For, they feel that multicultur
 alism hides the practice of racialism and
 does not deal with the issues of inequali
 ties of power and resources. They believe
 that multiculturalism only gives formal
 recognition to pluralities.
 Whatever be its positive contribu
 tions, the law under liberal democracy
 continues to remain mono-cultural and
 common law cannot rise above the exist
 ing dominant culture. The native leaders
 and activists point out that the Canadian
 claims to multiculturalism did not pre
 vent the state declaring the English and
 the French as founding nations. They
 ask why the Meech Lake Accord which
 recognised the Quebecois as a distinct na
 tion hesitates to assign a similar status to
 the indigenous peoples (Cairns 1988). Fur
 ther, they see multiculturalism as a ploy to
 deny special status to the aboriginal peo
 ples and pit other citizens against the in
 digenous peoples, by projecting the abo
 riginals as ethno-centric and chauvinist.
 Some scholars sympathetic to abori
 ginal peoples point out that by projecting

 everyone - including the indigenous peo
 ples as settlers, the advocates of multicul
 turalism veil antagonistic ethnic and
 racial interactions that characterise Ca
 nadian history till the second world war.
 Some scholars see multiculturalism as a
 strategy to manage ethnic and racial dif
 ferences in the Canadian society.
 In her work, Freda Hawkins (1982: 77)
 shows that the Canadian multicultural
 ism was not an outcome of change in the
 mindset of the majority population, but
 the result of pragmatic considerations of
 the Canadian bureaucrats and policy
 makers, who sought a new strategy to
 manage diversities in the changed
 national and international context. Him
 ani Bannerji in her critical work argues
 that multiculturalism does not merely
 recognise, but actually constitutes new
 differences to ensure white supremacy
 in Canadian society (Bannerji 2000).
 Carrying this argument further, Sunera
 Thobani argued that with the consti
 tution of people of colour as politically
 identifiable "Other", race will be recon
 figured as culture and cultural identity
 will be crystallised as political identity
 (Thobani 2007:145).
 Even scholars like Lance W Roberts
 and Rodney A Clifton conclude that
 Canadian multiculturalism tilts towards
 symbolic multiculturalism and gives
 lower priority to "institutionalised multi
 culturalism", which requires "a suffi
 ciently developed social structure to
 perpetuate cultural heritage" (Roberts
 and Clifton 1990: 120-39). Charles R
 Hale also says that multicultural state
 does not merely stop at "recognising"
 community, civil society, indigenous
 culture and the like, but "actively recon
 stitutes them in its own image, sheering
 them of radical excesses, inciting them
 to do the work of subject-formation that
 otherwise would fall to the state itself'
 (Hale 2002:485-524).
 Reconciliation
 In view of such criticisms and objections
 raised against multiculturalism by abo
 riginal activists and supporters, the
 Canadian state chose not to project multi
 culturalism as a solution to the problems
 of the aboriginal peoples. Militant First
 Nations movements in Canada seeking
 recognition of aboriginal rights also forced
 the Canadian government to recognise
 the specificity of the aboriginal question.
 Formation of aboriginal networks across
 the globe and the recognition of the
 rights of the indigenous peoples by inter
 national organisations such as the United
 Nations, the International Labour Organ
 isation and the World Bank also compel
 liberal democratic countries like Canada
 to respond positively and responsibly.
 Unlike the ethnic immigrants, who are
 content with equal citizenship and just
 treatment, the indigenous peoples of Can
 ada aspire for recognition of special rights
 as indigenous peoples. They have been
 raising demands for upholding historic
 treaties, or signing of new treaties; for res
 toration of aboriginal lands and territo
 ries; for control over natural resources, for
 autonomous self-governments and for
 protecting their aboriginal identity and
 cultural rights (Sanders 1985:532).
 Responding to the aboriginal concerns
 and movements, the Canadian state start
 ed taking positive steps from the 1970s
 onwards. The Constitution Act, 1982 rec
 ognised Native Indians, Inuit and Metis as
 aboriginal people and affirmed that their
 rights as aboriginal people predate the
 Canadian constitution. Section 35.1 of the
 constitution made it obligatory for the
 Canadian government to consult the rep
 resentatives of aboriginal peoples while
 proposing amendments to aboriginal
 rights and freedom.
 On their part, the Canadian courts
 have taken up the aboriginal cause by
 recognising natives' right to land and
 other treaty rights. For example, in Calder
 vs British Columbia case (1973), the Su
 preme Court of Canada recognised the
 existence of aboriginal title to lands that
 had not been surrendered to the crown. In
 Delgamuukw vs British Columbia (1997),
 the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that
 aboriginal people enjoy the right of
 exclusive use and occupation of territory
 if they can demonstrate that they have
 occupied the land prior to the assertion
 of British sovereignty, and that there has
 been continuity in the possession bet
 ween the present- and pre-sovereignty
 occupation. In the R vs Sparrow case
 (1990), the Supreme Court stated that
 the federal government could limit or in
 fringe upon a right of aboriginal people
 only if there existed a good reason for the
 law, and only if the law interfered with
 the aboriginal right in the least intrusive
 way possible. Failing to do so, the law
 would be deemed unconstitutional.
 Responding to the court decisions, the
 Canadian government took initiatives to
 conclude self-governments with different
 aboriginal communities. Mention may
 be made here of the Sechelt Indian Band
 Self-Government Act, Westbank First
 Nation Self-government Agreement, and
 James Bay and Northern Quebec Agree
 ment. Similarly, the government has
 been negotiating land agreements with
 different Inuit and First Nation commu
 nities. In provinces like British Columbia,
 initiatives have been taken to negotiate
 new treaties with various First Nation

 communities. Apart from addressing
 such basic issues, federal and provincial
 governments in Canada have initiated
 several policies and programmes for the
 aboriginal peoples in matters relating to
 education, employment, law and order,
 housing, health, culture, etc. Although
 these initiatives may be felt inadequate to
 undo the historical injustice done to the
 aboriginal peoples, the aboriginal policy
 definitely did help in addressing some of
 the vital issues concerning the aboriginal
 lives in Canada (Srikanth 2010:101-39).
 Conclusions
 Multiculturalism is both a philosophical
 and political response to the problems
 caused by increasing diversities and
 ethnic tensions in the modern states.
 Most liberal democracies in the world,
 including Canada, acknowledge the
 need for overcoming racial and ethnic
 prejudices that once characterised the
 state policies towards the minorities.
 However, the fact that these states have
 to work within the liberal-capitalist
 framework imposes limitations on how
 far multiculturalism could go in addre
 ssing to the problems of different minori
 ties in these countries. The critics have
 pointed out that the liberal state cannot
 go beyond "symbolic multiculturalism"
 and given the imperatives of the market
 economy, it is not possible to ensure
 institutional multiculturalism, which
 could give viable structural bases for the
 survival of different ethnic cultures. The
 aboriginal criticism of multiculturalism
 echoes many of these points.
 Aboriginal people in Canada were not
 content with a multicultural agenda
 ensuring citizenship and identity to all
 minorities. They show little interest in
 multiculturalism, as it fails to acknow
 ledge the specificity of aboriginal histo
 ry and uniqueness of their identity. They
 realise that their interests as aboriginal
 people cannot be protected by becoming
 a part of the salad bowl. Hence from the
 beginning, aboriginal people in Canada
 fought for their rights outside the frame
 work of multiculturalism. Of course, they
 realise that in the changed national and
 international context, it is not possible to
 attain political independence. So they
 seek maximum autonomy within the
 Canadian framework through treaties.
 They understand that genuine autonomy
 could be ensured only by having control
 over land and resources to sustain their
 economy and culture.
 Over the years, the Canadian state has
 also realised that it is not possible to tie
 down aboriginal people within the mul
 ticultural framework. Hence, it has
 evolved an aboriginal policy of its own
 and responded to the aboriginal demands
 for land, resource control, treaties and
 self-government. It is through compre
 hensive a aboriginal policy, and not
 through multiculturalism, that Canada is
 able to deal with the apprehensions and
 aspirations of the aboriginal peoples. It
 is true that such an aboriginal policy
 also cannot transcend the liberal capi
 talist framework. Yet, compared to the
 much publicised multicultural strategy,
 a sensible and sensitive aboriginal policy
 has the capacity to win over the confi
 dence of the aboriginal people.
