That Sole and Despotic Dominion
 There is nothing which so generally strikes the imagination, and engages the 
afections of mankind, as the right of property; or that sole and despotic do -
minion which one man claims and exercises over the external  thi ngs of the 
world, in total exclusion of the right of any other individual in the universe. 
And yet  there are very few, that  will g ive themselves the trou  ble to c onsider 
the original and foundation of this right.
— william blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of  Engl and, 1765
This chapter develops two genealogies of dispossession. The first, presented 
in section I, is a largely intra-  Eur opean account whereby the concept 
emerges in relation to a host of shifting proximate terms, such as expro -
priation, confiscation, and eminent domain. I argue that although the term 
originally operates within very long-  stand ing and abstract debates concern -
ing the nature of property per se, by the turn of the nineteenth  cen tury it 
takes on a much narrower, practical function as a tool of critique in relation 
to  battles against feudalism. Section II turns to a second context: Indigenous 
strug  gles against colonization. In this part of the chapter, I seek to di fer enti-
ate this conception from the first by attending to its unique recursivity. The

settler property law concerning squatters and homesteaders.

In W estern Eu  ro pean  lega l and po  liti cal t hought,  ther e is widespread and 
long-  standing recognition of the right of the sovereign to appropriate the 
property and assets of subjects, forcibly if necessary. Rather than finding a 
single unifying concept  under w hich to subsume this notion, one encounters 
instead a complex and confusing array of terms that vary according to time, 
location, custom, and vernacular. For the purposes of analytic treatment, 
however, this cacophony can be roughly or  ga nized i nto a set of four linguistic 
“families” in modern En  glish t hat, while overlapping and interrelated, can 
help parse distinct conceptual inflections. They include expropriation, con -
fiscation, eminent domain, and dispossession.
The Latinate term expropriation  was introduced into Eu  ro pean ve rnacu -
lar languages by the revival of Roman  lega l vocabulary by medieval civil and 
canon jurisprudents in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Since then, it has come to name the right of the sovereign to appropriate property for the sake of the “common good” in some sense or another ( publica utilitas, com-
munis utilitas, commune bonum
,  etc.). The paradigmatic expression of this 
power has long been the compelled seizure of land required for the building 
and maintenance of public infrastructure such as roads or  cas tle walls. For 
many centuries, of course, it was the sovereign who held ultimate interpre -
tative power over who counted as within the “public” or what was in the “common good.” As a result, expropriation was a highly flexible power; it could be expanded or contracted to suit a variety of schemes.

Precisely  because expropriation has had this variable scope, it has also 
had a retributive function. It this way, it has bled into confiscation. Derived from the Latin 
confiscare—  “to seize for the public treasury”—  this t erm re -
fers to the coercive seizure of property from subjects for the purposes of punishment. It has been used, for example, to strip criminals of their assets 
in the wake of conviction for crimes, or as retribution for po  liti cal and r e-
ligious insubordination. For instance, during the American Civil W ar, the Union passed two “Confiscation Acts” (1861, 1862) as a means of seizing southern lands and slaves as a punitive response to treason.

is sometimes treated as a species of expropriation, since  lega l enforcement

The two remain nevertheless partially distinct since confiscation com -
monly singles out a par  tic u lar ind ividual or group of individuals on the 
basis of their actions or standing relative to the sovereign. It is a mode of punitive forfeiture, tailored to a specific case.

In 1625 the Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius intervened in  these deb ates and 
in so  doing coined a new term. In On the Law of W ar and Peace , generally 
considered to be a foundational text in the history of international law, he introduced the term eminent domain as part of his argument that “through the agency of the king, even a right gained by subjects can be taken from 
them in two ways,  either a s a penalty, or by the force of eminent domain 
[dominium eminens]. But in order that this may be done by the power of eminent domain, the first requisite is public advantage; then, that compen -
sation from the public funds be made, if pos  si ble, t o the one who has lost 
his right.”4 Grotius did more than introduce a novel term, however. He also 
helped shift the register of the debate. His key contribution, followed by 
 later thinkers such as John Locke and Samuel von Pufendorf, was to con -
nect the specific right of expropriation to a general theory concerning the origin and nature of property as such.
 If the sovereign has a par  tic u lar r ight 
to seize property for the common good, this would seem to presuppose a superior claim on his part. Hence “eminent domain” has come to be used 
(rather confusingly) as both an act and as the under  lying fo rm of title that 
justifies that act. But how did the sovereign acquire that title in the first place?
One answer to this question was provided by vari  ous feuda l theories of 
title hierarchy. In this framework, the sovereign holds a special right of ex -
propriation  bec ause his title has priority, in both senses of the term: it was 
both older and superior. In his famous compendium of En  glish c ommon 
law (1765–79), William Blackstone summarized the feudal framework in the following way: “that the king is the universal lord and original propri -
etor of all the lands in his kingdom; and that no man doth or can possess any part of it, but what has mediately or immediately been derived as a 
gift from him, to be held upon feodal ser  vices .”5 Claims of this sort appear 
to have been strongest in medieval and early modern France, as well as on the Iberian Peninsula, where expropriation was justified as an exercise of seigniorial power.
6 In a dif  er ent idiom, this was part of Robert Filmer’s 
defense of absolutist monarchy in  Eng land, famously pilloried by Locke in 
The Two Treatises.

All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms  tha t sole and despotic dominion  19Within  these rather expansive theories of expropriation, special atten -
tion was paid to the  mat ter of “originary title, ” that is, the question of how 
one could acquire a proprietary interest in something that had no previ -
ous owner, for which  ther e was no prior claimant.7 In medieval and early 
modern Eu  ro pean ju risprudence, this came to be known as the prob  lem of 
res nullius.8 Standing  behind this concept is a relatively  simp le intuition: 
an object with no prior owner becomes the property of she who takes con -
trol over it first, who is said to have a right of preemption. Partially through 
the Roman revival, the idea that “preemptive acquisition” was a qualitatively 
distinct form of proprietary claim entered into Eu  ro pean civil and c anon 
law. Explaining and justifying this distinct moment was impor  tant, it w as 
thought,  because all subsequent property claims  wer e derivative of this 
“originary” moment. The  mat ter touched upon very  grand t heoretical ques -
tions, such as how  hum ans could come to assert legitimate private property 
claims in an originally common inheritance (from God), even absent “any 
express Compact of all the Commoners” (as Locke put it),9 but the  matter 
was also put to very practical purposes. In the early modern En  glish c on-
text, for instance, it validated novel acquisition over previously unclaimed or unused lands (for instance, by the draining of swamps). So the question of “originary possession” served a dual function, as part of a narrative about the origins of civil society and property per se and as a topical and practi -
cal intervention into the property relations of the pre  sent. I n this context, 
concepts of expropriation emerged as a means of explaining the sovereign’s prerogative to forcibly appropriate property and assets from subjects. The 
sovereign had a right of expropriation  bec ause he or she was the rightful 
inheritor of the originary possession of the land.
Grotius’s theory of eminent domain was motivated in part by a desire 
to displace this feudal theory of original possession. For him, although the sovereign still possessed a special right of expropriation, this had to be justi -
fied on dif  er ent g rounds. Rather than a seigniorial power, eminent domain 
was part of a contractualist, del  e ga tion t heory of sovereignty. The sovereign 
holds the right to seize assets for the public good not in virtue of person -
ally possessing a superior title but rather in light of his being empowered to adjudicate and legislate over the common good. Eminent domain was an extension of governmental authority, exercised on behalf of subjects who 
held an equiprimordial natu  ral right to property. Among other contribu -
tions, this theory provided an in  de pen dent no rmative benchmark by which 
to distinguish legitimate from illegitimate forms of expropriation. Subjects

All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms 20 Chapte r One were empowered to ask  whethe r any par  tic u lar exe rcise of expropriation or 
eminent domain was authentically undertaken for the common good.
Eminent domain remained for several centuries a relatively minor 
language of property seizure. It was used by a host of  lega l and po  liti cal 
theorists—  from Pufendorf to Emer de V attel and Denis Diderot—  but 
never became the dominant idiom, least of all in En  glish .10 This changed 
in the latter half of the eigh  tee nth  cen tury, however. At that point, Anglo set -
tler elites in British North Amer  i ca  wer e searching for intellectual resources 
that might help them in their bid for greater autonomy from imperial Lon -
don. As a result, they reached for continental Eu  ro pean t heorists who had 
been relatively overlooked in Britain. The result was that the language of 
“eminent domain” entered into  lega l and po  liti cal t heory of Anglo-  Amer ica 
and, to this day, remains the dominant way to express the idea of compul -
sory seizure of private assets for the public good in the United States (un -
like in  Great Britain, where it still has  litt le traction).11
Anglo-  American thought of this period is driven in no small part by 
a desire to defend the power of eminent domain on more purely liberal-  
Lockean grounds; that is, the sovereign holds this power only  bec ause he 
is acting as a representative and executor of the common  will . One way to 
establish  these liberal bona fides was to exaggerate the distinction between 
modern, liberal notions of eminent domain and Roman, medieval, or early 
modern feudal conceptions of expropriation. The standard form of this argument holds that, since the modern power of eminent domain is ex -
pressly about overriding individual private property interests, it cannot be 
said to have existed  unt il such interests  wer e already recognized. Hence, 
early American theorists of eminent domain commonly assert that, in this technical sense, it did not exist “before the title of the individual property owner as against the state was recognized and protected by law.” On this 
basis, modern eminent domain can be di ferentiated from  earlie r theories 
of expropriation in which “the right to take land for public use was merged in the general power of the government over all persons and property within its jurisdiction.”
12
 Under close inspection, however, this clean division does not hold up. 
One way to render their overlap vis  i ble is sim ply to note that, in the vast ma -
jority of cases, the sovereign right of expropriation carried a corresponding 
duty to compensation. Across medieval and early modern Eu  rop e, wide -
spread convention held that subjects  wer e owed fair recompense for their 
sacrifices to the common good, however necessary these sacrifices might be. This is tantamount to recognition that subjects, however “common” they

 Those whom a specific act of expropriation disadvantaged  wer e,  after all, 
part of the collective in whose name it was being enacted. (One signifi -
cant exception to this general rule was the case of expropriation as a form 
of punishment, which is why confiscation remains a partially distinct term of art.) In short, the general form of the argument across this period was 
that sovereigns held a right to expropriate not predominantly  bec ause they 
held ultimate and primordial title to the land but  bec ause they had a special 
responsibility to care for the community as a  whole and t o rule for its com -
mon good.
This framework provided two normative benchmarks: expropriation 
must be for the sake of the “common good” and attended by fair compen -
sation.  These two fea tures are impor  tant  bec ause they also provide lever -
age for a critique of illegitimate expropriation. This is where our final term enters the discussion, since dispossession has most often been used to mean 
“unjust expropriation.” The con  tem porary term can be traced backward 
through the  Middle E n glish disseisine  to the Anglo-  Nor man dessaisine (it -
self a variant of Old French). For many centuries,  these te rms  wer e used 
to name forms of wrongful seizure or removal. This was, in a literal sense, a condition characterized by a deprivation of seizine, meaning possession 
of land or chattel. The term has very old roots as well. For instance, in the 
Magna Carta of 1215, section 39 states, “No  free m an  shal l be seized or im -
prisoned, or stripped of his rights or possessions, or outlawed or exiled, or 
deprived of his standing in any other way, nor  will b e proceed with force 
against him, or send  others t o do so, except by the lawful judgment of his 
equals or by the law of the land.”13 In the original Latin, the first line is 
“Nullus liber homo capiatur vel imprisonetur aut disseisiatur.” Although the term disseisiatur is sometimes rendered as “stripped, ” it is more literally 
“disseised” or, in modern En  glish, “ dispossessed.” This etymological link 
endured for many centuries in En  glish  lega l and po  liti cal t hought. It was 
used by Hobbes in Leviathan (1651)14 and, much  later, remained evident in 
the 1833 Assize of novel disseisin , which dealt with recovering lands “recently 
dispossessed” from the plainti f.15
W e have then a clutch of concepts: expropriation, confiscation, eminent 
domain, and dispossession. Although overlapping, intersecting, and highly 
mutable, when taken together  these te rms nevertheless compose a scene 
regarding the shifting powers of property in the early modern Eu  ro pean 
world. Collectively, they express a dual desire: to name the legitimate right of the sovereign (and his delegates) to seize property for the common good

All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms 22 Chapte r Oneand, conversely, to condemn the abuse of this power. Whereas eminent 
domain is typically used only in ser  vice of t he former positive sense, dispos -
session has more often operated in the latter, critical register. Most confus -
ingly, expropriation has long been employed for both.
As I have already indicated, although each of  these te rms refers initially 
to a specific question of property acquisition, each is already implicated in 
broader theories of po  liti cal le gitimacy. This became all the more explicit 
as the concept of dispossession was expanded and radicalized in the late 
eigh  teenth and early nineteenth centuries. This is an impor  tant p eriod in the 
story that occupies our primary concern  here  bec ause it was at this point 
that it became pos  si ble to arg ue not simply that the sovereign had per -
formed a specific act of illegitimate property seizure but that sovereignty 
was itself  the e fect of a massive act of “unjust expropriation.”16
The entry point for this expanded notion of dispossession was the cen -
tral role that strug  gles ove r land tenure held in the context of revolts against 
feudalism. Rising republicanism of the mid to late eigh  tee nth  cen tury led 
to an increased concern with delegitimizing the very idea  of a permanent 
landed aristocracy. In the ser  vice of this critique, republican thinkers 
reached back to a rich (albeit quasi-  myt hological) Greco-  Rom an tradition, 
which placed  grea t emphasis on the virtues of fixed agricultural property, 
not only for the property holders but also for the po  liti cal c ommunity as 
a  whole. Fixed agricultural holdings, especially when held in small units 
by in  de pen dent f armers,  wer e thought to be the fount of republican ex -
cellence. Such farmers  wer e relatively autonomous in both a material and 
ethical sense: their unmediated access to land could provide them not only 
basic subsistence but also a medium for virtuous  labo r. Modern republican -
ism could critique feudalism on the basis of its perversion of this relation -
ship, since the majority of landholders  wer e no longer in  de pen dent f armers 
but proprietors of large estates funded by rent. This concern is quite clear 
in the analy  sis of Jean-  Jacq ues Rousseau, for instance, who was most critical 
of the kind of large landholdings that formed the foundation of the Eu -
ro pean nobility; but, as we  shal l see, it can also be seen in a host of  lat er 
anarchist and utopian socialist thinkers, from Marx to con  tem porary criti -
cal theory.17 So, although such questions entered into early modern Eu  ro-
pean  legal and po  liti cal t hought as an extension of very general and abstract 
questions about property as such, they soon came to function as tools in an 
urgent con  temporary po  lit i ca l strug  gle.

All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms  tha t sole and despotic dominion  23In this, the emphasis shifted from criticizing this or that par  tic u lar act of 
unjust expropriation (e.g., as implausibly for the sake of the common good) 
 toward a critique of feudal aristocratic rule as itself founded upon a massive 
act of dispossession.  Bec ause the language of expropriation had long been 
entangled in debates over the origins of property as such, many of  those 
who would  later seek to use it as a critical weapon against the feudal estates 
backdated the event of dispossession to “time-  imme morial” and the first 
moment of property formation. They therefore did not necessarily view the 
landed aristocrats of their own time as the primary agents  of expropriation 
but rather as the inheritors  of an original injustice, which had taken place 
in some long-  dist ant past. This is most clear in the words of Rousseau, who 
famously claimed:
The first man who, having enclosed a piece of ground, to whom it oc -
curred to say this is mine , and found  people sufficiently  simp le to believe 
him, was the true founder of civil society. How many crimes, wars, mur -
ders, how many miseries and horrors Mankind would have been spared by him who, pulling up the stakes or filling in the ditch, had cried out to his kind: Beware of listening to this imposter; Y ou are lost if you forget 
that the fruits are every  one’s and t he Earth no one’s.18
The fact that Rousseau bound the origins of civil society together so tightly 
with this quasi-  myt hological original expropriation meant that his argu -
ment generated divergent and contradictory responses. Some, such as many 
anarchists of the nineteenth  cen tury, called for the radical restructuring of 
state and society through the total abolition of actually existing property 
relations.  Others contended that, precisely  bec ause  hum an society as such 
was so tightly bound to an original expropriative act, the institutions of feudal tenure must be defended on the basis that abolition would entail the unraveling of civilization itself. A third position equivocated, calling for more moderate reform of existing institutions, accompanied by complex 
schemes that might compensate the rural peasantry, who, in their eyes,  wer e 
the inheritors of the original dispossessed.
Thomas Paine’s rather overlooked work “ Agrarian Justice” (1797) is an 
illustrative case of the latter position.19 In it, Paine argued that  ther e was 
no natu  ral or original case of “property in land, ” an institution that, for 
instance, he thought absent from biblical socie  ties. This changed with the 
advancement of cultivation. Cultivation permitted individuals to improve the land in such a way that it came to be transformed far beyond its original 
state.  Those improvements  wer e sown back into the earth, producing further

All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms 24 Chapte r Oneincreases in productivity. This generated inequalities, which eventually 
congealed into landed aristocracy. In one of the first instances of the En -
glish term being used in  these deb ates, Paine claimed that the resulting land 
mono  poly had “ dispossessed  more than half the inhabitants of  eve ry nation 
of their natu  ral i nheritance, without providing for them, as  ough t to have 
been done, as an indemnification for that loss, and has thereby created a 
species of poverty and wrechedness [sic ] that did not exist before.”20
As one can see,  ther e are in fact two normative concerns operating within 
Paine’s account. He is concerned, first, with the original moment of dispos-
session as intrinsically objectionable. As Paine puts it, in nature  ther e is “no 
such  thing as landed property.”  Those who firs t claimed it had “no right 
to locate as [their] property in perpetuity any part” of the land.21 Second, 
this original act of theft enabled a set of resultant evils, namely, widespread poverty among the decedents of the original dispossessed. So, for Paine, dispossession was objectionable both intrinsically and consequentially.
“ Agrarian Justice” was written while Paine was living in the midst of 
revolutionary France. He had at this point already served in the French Na -
tional Assembly and had gone through a trial that nearly led to his execu -
tion. The text came out of a set of proposals he wrote at the time arguing in 
 favor of a basic inheritance right, which he framed as compensation for the 
efective exclusion of the masses from the owner  ship of l and. It was part of 
a reformist agenda that sought to bridge radical and conservative positions. For Paine, although the aristocracy had certainly taken advantage of its 
mono  poly privilege, current holders of land titles  wer e not themselves di -
rectly responsible for the context itself, in  either a moral or  lega l sense. “The 
fault, ” as he put it, “is not in the pre  sent p ossessors.  . . .  The fau lt is in the 
system, and it has stolen imperceptibly upon the world, aided afterwards by 
the Agrarian law of the sword.” The key then was to transform the under -
lying system of owner  ship, idea lly “without diminishing or deranging the 
property of any of the pre  sent p ossessors, ” a pro  cess t hat might require “suc -
cessive generations.”22 Paine’s proposed solution was a new taxation system 
that would serve a compensatory and redistributive function, providing in -
demnification to the dispossessed for their regrettable, albeit unavoidable, historic loss. This general compensatory approach to the exclusion of the 
rural poor from landholding enjoyed significant support in the eigh  tee nth 
and early nineteenth centuries. It played a role in utopian socialist proj  ects 
aimed at giving the poor opportunities to return to agrarian living or, failing 
that, to receive support in the form of Poor Law re  dist ributions. In  Great 
Britain, it eventually led to the Return of  Owners of Land  (1873), a modern

aristocratic land owner  ship i n that country.23 As  shall be discussed at length 
in the sections to come, it also played a role in the justification of settler 
colonization schemes abroad, which held out similar promises of return to 
in de pen dent self-  rule t hrough individualized landholding, perhaps finding 
its purest theoretical advocate in Thomas Je ferson.
Debates of this sort reached something of a zenith in the classical anar -
chism of the mid to late nineteenth  cen tury. At that time, several promi -
nent thinkers (including Pierre-  Josep h Prou  dhon and P eter Kropotkin) 
advanced the claim that modern Eu  ro pean na tion-  sta tes  wer e the emana -
tions of acts of massive theft, specifically the theft of land from the rural 
peasantry. As Prou  dhon pu t it at that time: “Through the land the plunder -
ing of man began, and in the land it has rooted its foundations. The land 
is the fortress of the modern cap  i tal ist, as it w as the citadel of feudalism, 
and of the ancient patriciate. Fi  nal ly, it is the land which gives authority to 
the government princi  ple, an ev er- rene wed strength, whenever the popu  lar 
Hercules overthrows the  giant. ”24 As we can see  here, l ike Rousseau,  these 
thinkers envisioned the original partition of the earth to constitute an an -
cient violation, a “plundering.” And, like Paine, they  wer e attentive to its 
con temporary ramifications. Unlike liberals such as Paine, however, they 
drew a more radical conclusion, expressly repudiating the notion that dis-possession could be remedied “without diminishing or deranging the prop -
erty of any of the pre  sent p ossessors.” Instead, they concluded that modern 
property relations  wer e illegitimate in a more general sense, since other 
forms of in  equality  wer e derivative of the originary seizure of communal 
land. Hence, the famous slogan of nineteenth-  cen tury anarchists: Prop -
erty is theft!  25 In this, terms such as expropriation came to play an increas -
ingly impor  tant role in naming this ongoing, structured theft. By the end 
of the nineteenth  cen tury, the term had expanded and radicalized to the 
point that Kropotkin could worry only of “not  goi ng far enough, ” that is, 
of “carry  ing out expropriation on too small a scale to be lasting.” Instead, he 
argued in his 1892 text, The Conquest of Bread , that “expropriation should 
be general, ” equating it with “a universal rising.”26
In sum, then, the concept of expropriation entered into Eu  ro pean  lega l 
and po  liti cal thought as a means to stabilize and legitimize extant power 
relations and sovereign authority. It was, however, si  mul  ta neously i nverted 
and redeployed as a tool of social criticism, that is, to destabilize and trans -
form power and property. In this, it was joined to a host of other concepts, 
most notably dispossession and eminent domain.  There is a d iscernable

(from roughly the early seventeenth  cen tury to the late nineteenth), in 
which the terms came increasingly to be freed from their original uses and 
set to new, more radical and critical purposes. Eventually, it became pos -
si ble and even plausible to use  these as t erms in the condemnation of es -
tablished property relations rather than in their vindication. Perhaps most 
dramatically, it was eventually pos  si ble to ac cuse the sovereign not merely 
of a specific act of illegitimate expropriation but of himself being the e fect of 
a prior dispossession: the sovereign as thief.
Marx represents something of a turning point in this critical history. 
Although initially impressed by the anarchist critique,27 Marx eventually 
came to view this analy  sis as in adequate and improperly formulated. By 
positing that classical, feudal, and modern forms of domination all ema -
nated from the same fount (i.e., land appropriation), anarchists generated a 
falsely abstract and ahistorical conception of “expropriation, ” one that failed to grasp the specificity of modernity and capitalism. Moreover, in hitch -
ing their critique to the language of theft, they had  adopte d a restrictively 
 legal and moralistic category, one that in fact presupposed and naturalized 
a similarly abstract and ahistorical conception of property. For Marx, the 
anarchist slogan “Property is theft!” was therefore self-  refu ting, since the 
concept of theft presupposes the existence of property.28 Even before Marx 
arrived at this conclusion, Max Stirner made a similar observation. In his major work, The Ego and Its Own  (1844), he wrote: “Is the concept of ‘theft’ 
at all pos  si ble  unles s one allows validity to the concept ‘property’? How can 
one steal if property is not already extant? What belongs to no one cannot be stolen
; the  water that one draws out of the sea he does not steal.  Accordingly 
property is not theft, but a theft becomes pos  si ble on ly through property.”29 
In e fect,  these critics  wer e pointing out that property must be logically, 
chronologically, and normatively prior to theft. The latter cannot be foun -
dational to  either p roperty relations or civil society more generally.
In the shuttling back and forth between anarchist and Marxist positions 
on the question of property and theft, we can observe an in  ter est ing c or-
relate movement of conceptual and linguistic translation. Within classical anarchism, the French term expropriation came to function as a placeholder 
for the pro  cesses of large-  scale “ theft” that  wer e viewed as constitutive of 
the modern state system itself. When Marx engaged  these deba tes, he used 
both the Germanic term Enteignung and the Latinate Expropriation, some -
what inconsistently.30 Fi nally, and somewhat confusingly, when Das Kapital  
was translated into En  glish, t he relevant terms  wer e often, but incon -

expropriation, sometimes as distinct). From this point on, the latter term 
enters English-  spea king debates and now enjoys wide circulation across 
a variety of critical traditions and thinkers, from David Harvey to Judith 
Butler.
As  these key terms  wer e translated linguistically, so too  wer e they reno -
vated conceptually. Anarchist thinkers had posited that the seizure of com -
munal lands was itself a vio  lence c ommitted against the feudal peasantry by 
the aristocratic nobility, and that this was essentially theft: it was a coercive 
and illegitimate transfer of property from the original  owne rs. Although 
Marx continued to speak of Expropriation and Enteignung, he changed the 
meaning of  these terms when he provided a more abstract definition. For 
him, dispossession came to refer to the initial “separation-  pro cess” ( Scheid-
ungsprozeß ) that separated “immediate producers” from direct access to the 
means of production, thus forcing them into new  labo r conditions, now 
mediated by way of the wage.31 This implied a conceptual shift away from 
viewing dispossession in terms of “theft, ” strictly speaking. Whereas the original anarchist argument presented the rural peasantry as the original 
“ owners” of the land, Marx sought to shear this critique from its normative 
investment in property.
In the next chapter, we  will unpack the logic of Marx’s engagement 
with the concepts of expropriation and dispossession in greater detail. For now, it suffices to highlight two results of this broader critique of anarchist 
thought. First,  these ca tegories  wer e slowly displaced as tools of radical 
politics, becoming narrowly legalistic terms. The expansive normative and 
critical sense with which Rousseau, Paine, or Prou  dhon s poke of dispos -
session, for instance, was collapsed into the  earlie r, more technical and 
legalistic categories of expropriation and eminent domain with which we 
are familiar  tod ay (serving now, somewhat ironically, to legitimate state 
seizure of private property). Second, insofar as the category did persist as a tool of social criticism, it was subsumed beneath other, more fundamen -
tal concepts.
32 The historical result of this has been that, within the more 
Marxian-  inspired lineages of critical theory, the question of dispossession 
has been subordinated to other concerns, specifically its role in generating 
a class of proletarianized workers. In terms of a historical-  descri ptive nar -
rative, dispossession moves from being a story of “originary theft”  tow ard 
a more localized claim about the rise of the modern capital relation. In the terms of normative theory, it loses any sense of its intrinsic injustice, and is instead rendered objectionable only in terms of its consequences,

to which I  will return).
II
The concept of dispossession has enjoyed a re  nais sance of sor ts. As was out -
lined in the introduction, it has come to be seen as a useful analytic device 
in con  temporary debates surrounding colonialism (in both its historical 
and present-  day manifestations), particularly in the Anglo settler world. 
In this new usage, echoes may be heard of the previous intra-  Eur opean 
debates sketched above. Most obviously, in its deployment by Indigenous 
 peoples, dispossession retains connotations of “land theft” long associated 
with strug  gles against Eu  ro pean feuda lism, albeit transposed now to name 
the specific territorial acquisition logic of settler colonization. However, 
as is hopefully clear by now, when the term dispossession migrates into dis -
cussions on colonization, a certain danger emerges. On the one hand, it is potentially problematic to adopt the classical anarchist strategy of con -
struing dispossession as a case of straightforward theft since this leaves one vulnerable to both traditional objections from the Marxian camp and more opportunistic critiques from the right (discussed in the introduction). On the other hand, however, the route provided by the Marxist reply to anar -
chism may also prove inadequate, since this drags the heart of the  whole 
 matter away from expropriation  tow ard exploitation. It would seem very 
odd indeed to suggest that the dispossession of Indigenous  peo ples from 
their lands is problematic  bec ause it enables their exploitation as laborers, 
since this is empirically not a very accurate description of the experience of 
colonization faced by many Indigenous  peo ples (especially in the Anglo 
settler world), but more to the point, it seems to distort the under  lying 
logic of  these strug  gles.
I contend that this dilemma is a function of the paucity of historical re-
constructive work of the  actua l institutions of landed property in the Anglo 
settler world and their impact on the development of Indigenous traditions 
of re  sis tance and critique. In short, we must understand more precisely how 
landed property came to function as a tool of colonial domination in such a way as to generate a unique “dilemma of dispossession, ” which is not reduc-
ible to the one experienced by Eu  ro pean rad icals.
Before turning to that alternative genealogy, however, it is impor  tant 
to note that, just as the term had a complex variety of uses and proximate

All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms  tha t sole and despotic dominion  29terms in the Eu  ro pean deba tes, so too it does in this (colonial) context. 
Indeed, an alternative route around the above dilemma is to point out that, 
for many Indigenous  peo ples, dispossession is not  real ly about possession at 
all. In this strategy, although the word  is used to describe something specific 
about the territoriality of Indigenous social and po  liti cal  orde rs or its role 
in settler colonization, the “possessive” part of dispossession is rendered 
rather more incidental. In this case, we might  real ly mean something like 
deracination or desecration. The first of  these te rms denotes a form of “up -
rooting” and carries connotations of displacement and removal. It can have 
literal and more meta  phor ical uses (as is the case with, say, dislocation) and 
has a certain intuitive appeal since the expropriation of the territorial foun -
dation of a society  will clear ly have a massively negative, disruptive e fect 
on that society. Dispossession qua deracination carries its own ambiguities 
and dangers, of course. It may, for instance, suture indigeneity to territorial 
fixity, an issue I  will not ex plore  here.33 However, the language of deracina -
tion does seem at least to lead us away from implying that that relationship to land must in its original form be a propertied one.
At other times when  peo ple use the term dispossession  in  these contexts, 
they seem to  real ly mean something like desecration. In this valence, Indig -
enous  peoples often raise a concern with the degradation or defilement of 
some object of concern whose moral worth cannot be mea  sur ed in purely 
anthropocentric terms. What is in  ter est ing ab out this framework is that the 
primary object of injury has changed. Whereas deracination, theft, exploi -
tation, and coercion are all  thi ngs that happen to the  hum an inhabitants as 
a result of land appropriation, desecration implies that the Earth itself is the 
injured party. This is not to say that  ther e cannot be some additional injury 
to the  human inhabitants, but this shifts to the level of a secondary e fect . 
Consider the following passage from the Mohawk  lega l scholar Patricia 
Monture-  Angus:
Although Aboriginal  Peo ples maintain a close relationship with the 
land  . . .  it is not about c ontrol of the land.  . . .  Eart h is  mother and  
she nurtures us all.  . . .  Sove reignty, when defined as my right to be 
 responsible  . . .  req uires a relationship with territory (and not a relation -
ship based on control of that territory).  . . .  What m ust be understood 
then is that Aboriginal request to have our sovereignty respected is 
 really a request to be responsible. I do not know of anywhere  else in 
history where a group of  peo ple have had to fight so hard just to be 
responsible.34

All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms 30 Chapte r OneWhat is motivating about this rendering is the novel way in which the 
claims and relationships  here h ave been reversed from the standard propri -
etary model. Monture-  Ang us provides us with a clear example of an argu -
ment that does not rest on a normative commitment to property in land 
but still leverages a strong critique of territorial acquisition. The impor  tant 
ele ment is that she has converted a traditionally rights-  base d claim into a 
duty-  based one. As she construes it, Aboriginal title is a claim about the 
necessity of being responsible to something greater than oneself, that is, 
the Earth itself. This seems to get us out of some of the complications of the strictly proprietary use of dispossession and brings us closer to the desecra -
tion sense of the term.
I explore  these alternative formulations in greater detail in  lat er chapters.35 
Let us set them aside for the moment, however, in order to give our origi -
nal problematic a more thorough treatment. If I do so, it is not  bec ause 
the rendering given by thinkers such as Monture-  Ang us is not impor  tant 
or convincing. Rather, we may wish to explore alternatives  bec ause, for in -
stance, not all Indigenous  peo ples and communities  will view their rela -
tionship to the Earth in this way. What is more, as any engagement with 
the  actual writings and works of such  peo ple reveals,  ther e is a palpable 
sense in which Indigenous communities in the Anglo settler world have experienced, and continue to experience, colonization as a form of theft . 
Notwithstanding all the complications just raised, then,  ther e is a certain 
claim  here to the e fect that this land is stolen, a claim that cannot be simply 
sidestepped if we wish to remain responsive to the specific historical experi -
ence at stake. W e may wish then to persist in grappling with the language 
of theft out of an interest in engaging  these cla ims as they are presented to 
us, perhaps precisely  bec ause the issue at hand does not fit neatly into ex -
pected frames of reference. Continuing to speak of dispossession qua “theft 
of land” would then not simply be impor  tant a s part of a rhetorical strategy, 
or as a princi  ple of sol idarity (although  these ma y also be impor  tant c onsid -
erations). Rather, it would be worth retaining  these te rms  bec ause they in 
fact express an appropriate and conceptually complex apprehension of the 
nature of prob  lem at h and.
Part of what continues to motivate the use of the term dispossession in 
 these contexts, I contend, is the real sense that colonization (especially 
settler colonization) does involve a unique species of theft for which we do not always have adequate language. First, dispossession of this sort 
combines two pro  cesses t ypically thought distinct: it transforms nonpro -
prietary relations into proprietary ones while, at the same time, systemati -

thus not (only) about the transfer of property but the transformation into  
property. In this way, dispossession creates an object in the very act of ap -
propriating it.
How exactly does this work? How can dispossession be said to fuse the 
making and taking of property? The answer depends on clarifying what it means to “make” property. Part of the confusion around this derives from 
the per  sis tent ambiguity in the ordinary language sense of property. Most 
of the time, when we speak of our “property, ” we think of a collection of 
objects: cars,  houses, cloth ing, and the like. However, as almost all critical-  
theoretical treatments of the category begin by reminding us, in point of fact, property does not refer to a set of 
 things. Rather, it refers to a species 
of relations.36 T o claim property in something is, in e fect, to construct a re -
lationship with  others, n amely, a relation of exclusion. Most often, to assert 
property in something is to make an enforceable claim to exclude someone 
from access to some  thi ng. The fact that property is  real ly a form of social 
relation (and not a par  tic u lar ki nd of object) is made most dramatically vis -
i ble when we consider that  ther e need not be any physical tangible entity 
in which the claim is lodged. Y ou can have property in an idea, a technique 
for  doing something, even an expectation. The object in which you have a 
claim need not be, therefore, a physical entity. But it must be cognizable as 
a distinct juridical object, something that can in princi  ple be r endered the 
repository of an enforceable claim against  others . So “making” property 
refers not to the creation of a new material object but to a new juridical and 
conceptual object—an abstraction—  tha t serves to anchor relations, rights, 
and, ultimately, power.
In this context we are concerned with how “land” was rendered as 
“property.” Although it may first appear as a perfectly obvious, empirical object, “land” is in fact a concept, and a highly abstract one at that.
37 W e are 
essentially talking about taking a portion of the Earth’s surface—  exclud ing 
the subsurface and troposphere beyond some often vaguely formulated or 
unspecified distance—  and bundl ing a complex diversity of proprietary 
claims within it such that a person could, in princi  ple, acq uire control over 
all objects and activities within that zone. As a  lega l and marketable object 
of this sort, land in this sense is a highly culturally and historically specific object in which one could invest property claims. It is not the case that all 
socie  ties—  even most socie  ties—  hav e had such a concept, let alone a set 
of  legal and po  liti cal i nstitutions to enforce claims around it, or a market 
through which it could be traded.

All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms 32 Chapte r OneAs we  shall see in periodic historical reconstructions throughout this 
book, when Eu  ro pean co lonizers encountered the diverse socie  ties of the 
so- called New W orld, they frequently found that Indigenous  peo ples had 
no conception of land in this abstract and narrow sense. (Rather than view -
ing this in terms of a  simp le lack, many Indigenous thinkers have consid -
ered it a positive feature of their socie  ties th at they did not partition Earth 
in this manner.38) Accordingly, the pro  cess of d ispossessing them entailed a 
rather complex gesture of ascribing this peculiar property form to them but 
in such a way as to facilitate its divestiture. Put more generally, we can say 
that dispossession is a pro  cess i n which novel proprietary relations are gen -
erated but  under structural conditions that demand their simultaneous ne -
gation.  Those imp acted by this process—  the dis possessed—  may e ven come 
to attach to  these new relations, experiencing them (or ele  ment s of them) 
as a positive development in the sense that the pro  cess entails a nominal 
expansion of their proprietary rights; that is, they have gained a new form of property (in this case, “land”). However, they can also come to experi -
ence a deep conflict between the abstract form of the proprietary right and the conditions for its realization. The reason for this is that the disposses -
sive pro  cess has also changed background social conditions such that the 
actualization of the proprietary right in question is necessarily mediated in 
such a way as to e fectively negate it. In e fect, the dispossessed may come to 
“have” something they cannot use, except by alienating it to another.
This formulation helps explain the paradoxical phenomenon we find in 
the history of settler colonialism of colonizers who si  mul  ta neously affi rm 
and deny Indigenous proprietary interests in land. In the long and com -
plex history of the Eu  ro pean co lonization of the (now) Anglo settler world, 
we of course find numerous examples of colonial figures who simply deny outright the very possibility of Indigenous property in land, typically as a 
function of Indigenous  peo ples’ supposedly lower levels of socioeconomic 
development, rationality, techniques of cultivation, enclosure, and the like. As has been well documented, thinkers from V attel to Locke to Immanuel 
Kant have all doubted  whethe r Indigenous  peo ples have ever had the 
socioeconomic and technological development required to truly take pos -
session of land. Alongside  these bl anket denials, however, we also find vari -
ous forms of partial recognition and selective affirmation of Indigenous proprietary interests. Historically, settlers have routinely affirmed certain 
forms of Indigenous property rights  bec ause they have recognized that, in 
a consolidating colonial-  cap italist context, Indigenous  peo ples can only 
actualize their property rights through alienation.39 The Lakota (Standing

ture of dispossession in his landmark 1969 work, Custer Died for Y our Sins.
One day the white man discovered that the Indian tribes still owned 
some 135 million acres of land. T o his horror he learned that much of 
it was very valuable.  . . .  Ani mals could be herded together on a piece 
of land, but they could not sell it. Therefore it took no time at all to 
discover that Indians  wer e  real ly  peo ple and should have the right to sell 
their lands. Land was the means of recognizing the Indian as a  hum an 
being. It was the method whereby land could be stolen legally and not 
blatantly.  . . .  Discove ry negated the rights of the Indian tribes to sover -
eignty and equality among the nations of the world. It took away their title to their land and gave them the right only to sell.
40
Deloria is putting his fin  ger  here o n a peculiar nominal or “negative prop -
erty” right enjoyed by Indigenous  peo ples in colonial contexts: the right 
“only to sell.” In phrasing  mat ters this way, Deloria is drawing upon a long 
and rich heritage (discussed at greater length in chapter 3). Above all, he lays bare the specific mechanics of dispossession, whereby Indigenous prop -
erty is only cognizable by W estern law in and through its alienation.
It serves to recall that the standard form of a property right is a tripar -
tite conjunction of exclusive rights to acquisition, use and enjoyment, and alienation.
41 In the context of evolving forms of settler colonial capitalism, 
however, the structure of “Indigenous property” emerged as an already paradoxical conjunction, a truncated form of property that could only be fully expressed in the third moment, that is, alienation. In other words, it is 
fully realized only in its negation . This is what Deloria is pointing to in say -
ing that “Indians” have only a “right to sell.” In this case, Indigenous  peo ples 
are not fully excluded from holding property per se but instead have come to possess an empty or truncated proprietary interest, one that cannot be actualized except through divestment.
This is why the claims of Indigenous  peo ples may appear question-  
begging from our standpoint in the pre  sent. I ndigenous  peo ples are figured 
as the “original  owne rs of the land” but only retroactively, that is, refracted 
backward through the pro  cess it self. In this case, then, Indigenous original 
propertied interests in this object called “land” are only rendered cogni -
zable in a retrospective moment, viewed backward and refracted through 
the pro  cess of generating a distinct form of “structurally negated” property 
right in it. The original proprietary interest is only vis  i ble  after it has been 
lost. Viewed in this way, Indigenous claims to the land are not mistaken

text, possession does not precede dispossession but is its e fect. Rather than 
avoid the prob  lem of a neg atively defined concept, we should therefore 
highlight precisely the recursive  logic at work  here a s the essential feature of 
the specific pro  cess  under c onsideration.
In sum, the recursive movement at work  here m ay be plotted as one of 
transformation (making), transference  (taking), and retroactive attribution  
(belated ascribing). When worked out in relation to this specific context, 
this reformulated conception helps us avoid some of the false dilemmas 
sketched above since it can name a pro  cess of d ispossession without pre -
suming an original possession or requiring a theory of “first occupancy.” Contrary to Stirner’s direct assertion, what belongs to no one can in fact be stolen. It is to the long and sordid history of this peculiar mode of theft  that Indigenous authors and activists are referring when they employ the 
language of dispossession  tod ay.42
Ultimately, however, if we are to conceive of dispossession as consisting 
in a relationship between a juridical structure of right and the social con -
text that actualizes that system of right in a “negative” manner, we cannot remain at the level of theoretical assertion. It must be demonstrated, not 
stipulated. A full account  will ne ed to explain both that de jure structure 
and its de facto actualization. W e  will need to demonstrate precisely how 
proprietary interests can be “structurally negated” by a background social context. It is to this background horizon that we now turn.

Settler colonialism in the Anglophone world has always been inextricably 
linked to a transformation in  hum an relations to land. The eventual “rise of 
the Anglosphere”—  part icularly dramatic in the nineteenth  cen tury—  was 
a “metaphysical revolution.”43 In and through this pro  cess, l and came to be 
understood as something that could be not only individuated in mea  sur ed, 
discrete units but also abstracted and registered in  lega l codes that could 
be circulated, traded, and pledged. As  these cip hers  wer e or  ga nized i nto 
a “market, ” their relation to the  actua l physical spaces they  wer e meant 
to represent was increasingly attenuated. As historian John W eaver puts 
it, “By an astonishing conceptual revolution, worked out in both old-   and 
new-  world settings, the most tangible and non-  moveable p roperty conceiv -
able was or  ga nized into interests and condensed into paper assets that, in

All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms  tha t sole and despotic dominion  35good market conditions, could be cycled quickly from person to person, 
person to corporation, corporation to corporation, corporation to person, and so on.”
44 This was a pro  cess t hat took place in both “old” and “new” world 
settings, in Eu  rop e and its colonies. It was part of the global pro  cess t hat 
Karl Polanyi theorized as the “  Great T ransformation, ” which he linked 
(albeit in peripheral ways) to colonization.45 What makes the Anglo settler 
colonial world such a unique and impor  tant lens through which to study 
this, however, is that it was a space where state formation and market for -
mation not only took place si  mul  ta neously — the eme rgence of a modern 
 legal, governmental apparatus was coeval with the emergence of a market 
in land—  but also that this was done in explicit opposition to Indigenous 
forms of life that presented radically distinct and divergent visions of the 
relationship between  hum an socie  ties and the l ands on which they lived. 
Thus, the structure of property in land that took hold in the Anglo settler 
world was systematically oriented  tow ard the dispossession of Indigenous 
 peoples in a unique and noncontingent manner.46
That Anglo settler colonialism is inextricably linked to the emergence of 
a market in land is most obviously true in the case of the United States. As 
one con  temporary economist rather unapologetically boasts: “ Amer  i ca ha s 
always been a nation of real estate speculators.  . . .  Real estate speculation 
was an integral part of the ‘winning of the west, ’ the construction of our cities, and the transformation of American home life, from tenements to 
mini-  mansions.”47 In one sense, this is correct. Many of the leading figures 
of the American Revolution made their fortunes in real estate speculation. They specialized in acquiring vast swaths of land from a public entity (origi -
nally from the Crown), parceling it out and selling it to smaller investors at large profits. This group included George W ashington, Benjamin Frank -
lin, and Thomas Je ferson but also lesser-  know n figures such as Robert 
Morris, Nathaniel Phelps, Oliver Gorham, and other influential financiers of the revolutionary period. Through land speculation companies such as 
the Ohio Com  pany , the V andalia Com  pany , and the Loyal Land Com  pany 
before it, the Anglo settler elite of the eigh  tee nth and nineteenth centuries 
was built upon the commercial trade in land.48
 There  were huge amounts of money to be made in the earliest rounds 
of land acquisition and sale. In the early 1790s, Alexander Hamilton esti-mated that 30 cents per acre was a fair price for government frontier land. 
Only a few short years  lat er, the 1796 congress considered a $2 minimum 
sale price to be reasonable.49 By 1850 New Y ork State land was valued 
at $29 per acre. Adjusted to con  tem porary prices, that is a change from

All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms 36 Chapte r One approximately $7.50 to $35 to $854  in sixty years.50 The role of govern -
ment was to regulate and control the pace of expansion so as to prevent the 
formation of real estate  bubbles, w hich could cause recessions when they 
burst. Periodic real estate collapses did, of course, bankrupt many (includ -
ing Robert Morris, who was imprisoned for his debts in 1798) and by 1819 
left an estimated $21 million owed to the federal government from defunct land speculators, approximately $12 million of which was linked to the newly opened Alabama territory alone.
51 The U .S. government responded 
with a variety of relief mea  sur es, including releasing new forms of credit 
available for the purchase of public land.52 The most impor  tant c redit pol -
icy of the boom period between 1797 and 1819 was the Land Act of 1800, 
which enabled purchasers to acquire public land by fronting a mere one-  
twentieth of the initial cost.53
The  great Chicago land boom and bust of the 1830s and 1840s is often 
held up as an exemplary case of the general pattern of U .S. westward expan -
sion through speculation. In the 1820s,  ther e was virtually no market for 
land in that area of the frontier, and thus land was e fectively worthless as 
a commodity.54 By 1830 it was some of the most expensive real estate on 
the continent and, by one estimate, increased by nearly 40,000   per cent in 
that de  cade alone.55 In 1840 a partial collapse of this  bubble g enerated a 
wave of foreclosures by the Bank of Illinois, which itself promptly declared bankruptcy in 1842.
56 In the thirty years following the initial land boom, 
Chicago’s population went from a few hundred to approximately 109,000 
inhabitants. In the next thirty years  after s tabilizing the land market, it re -
peatedly doubled, reaching 1.1 million by 1890.57
The Civil W ar did  litt le to slow westward expansion. It was during this 
period that Congress passed the Morrill Act, setting aside huge swaths of newly acquired public lands for the establishment of a network of new land grant universities, and the Pacific Railroad Act, which provided pri-vate companies with an estimated two hundred million acres of Indigenous land, often in direct contravention of treaty obligations.
58 Indigenous 
 peoples  were slowly brought into the land market but only  under highly 
unequal terms, often through agreements that  tod ay would be recognized 
as forms of predatory lending.59 For example, the Choctaws  wer e forced 
by such pressures to sell a majority of their lands for $50,000 in 1805. The 
Chickasaws followed suit soon  after , releasing all their land north of the T en -
nessee River for $20,000.60

As Roxanne Dunbar-  Ort iz puts it, in the first few de  cades of U .S. i n de pen-
dence, “land became the most impor  tant ex change commodity for the ac -
cumulation of capital and building of the national trea  sur y.”61 This created 
tensions between dif  er ent a spects of the state building pro  cess, t hat is, be -
tween territorial expansion, capital accumulation, and the rule of law. This 
often played out in terms of competition between government agents (such as surveyors, bureaucrats, and auctioneers), homesteading squatters, and 
financier-  speculators, consideration of which necessarily engages broader 
questions of how to theorize the relationship between state and capital 
formation in settler colonial contexts.  These dif  er ent a gents had distinct 
and often mutually conflicting immediate goals and objectives. However, 
over long-  term cycles, they  wer e nevertheless able to generate a certain reso -
nance (even if not total consonance) between their dif  er ent p roj ects so a s 
to produce a relatively stable e fect: dispossession.
Once set into motion, the dispossessive logic of settler colonization 
proved difficult to control. Issuing a warning in the precise vocabulary with 
which we are  here c oncerned, the secretary of war  under G eorge W ash -
ington, Henry Knox (no friend to Indigenous  peo ples generally), argued 
in 1789 that,  bec ause Indigenous  peo ples  wer e prior occupants, they “pos -
sess the right of the soil. It cannot be taken from them  unles s by their  free 
consent, or by the right of conquest in case of a just war. T o dispossess them 
on any other princi  ple, wou ld be a gross violation of the fundamental laws 
of nature, and of that distributive justice which is the glory of a nation.”62 
Echoing and concretizing this sentiment, in 1785 Congress issued a procla -
mation forbidding unlawful settlement and authorizing the secretary of war 
to remove  those in the breach.63 In 1806 the term squatter was used for the 
first time in congressional debates to refer to the growing prob  lem of cla ims 
obtained outside the formally recognized and legally sanctioned pro  cess .64 
Formal, legislative prohibition peaked in the form of the Intrusion Act of 1807, which forbid U .S. citizens not only from unlawfully taking possession 
or making settlements but also from surveying, designating bound  aries, or 
even marking trees in such a way as to facilitate a  fut ure claim. It moreover 
reauthorized the president and his officials “to employ such military force 
as he may judge necessary and proper” to remove o fenders.65
Congress faced two obstacles in its attempt to curtail settler expansion 
by legislative means. First and foremost, legislative control over illegal squat -
ting was practically unenforceable. By the early nineteenth  cen tury, settlers 
had grown in numbers and technical competences to be an  in de pen den t

This was proven time and again as the new republic strug  gled t o enforce 
its frontier laws. Army officers  wer e sent out to the countryside, charged 
with handing out and collecting fines as well as enforcing foreclosures and 
jail sentences. In July 1827, federal troops  wer e sent into Indian land in Al -
abama, where they forcibly removed squatters, burning their homes and 
crops. Repeated periodically throughout the 1830s and 1840s, this came to be known as the “Intruders’ W ar.”
66 Among other difficulties of enforce -
ment, soldiers  wer e generally sympathetic to squatters, not a surprise given 
that cheap frontier land was a common reward for ser  vice.
The second prob  lem w as more abstract. State mea  sur es against intrusion 
relied on a clear understanding of the legality  of settlement for their consis-
tent application and enforcement.  Her e we encounter a unique conceptual 
prob  lem. Anglo settler states have historically faced a complicated gesture 
of si  mul  ta neously avowing and disavowing the rule of law, that is, of squar -
ing their reliance on extralegal vio  lence a s constitutive to their founding 
and continued expansion with their self-  ima ge as distinctly  free so cie ties 
governed by the rule of law. The distinction between legality and illegality 
that operates in the land acquisition pro  cess of a set tler state is particularly 
fraught and unstable. It requires positing the state as the legitimate source of law, while acknowledging, even fostering, the extralegal mechanisms 
that make this pos  si ble. On t he one hand, the state is figured as the origina -
tor of law, which is meant to secure its validity and its distinctiveness from other nonstate forms of coercion (which have not been publicly validated and thus cannot avail themselves of the status of law). On the other hand, 
the state itself must arise out of extralegal force, for  ther e is no prior law that 
can validate founding itself; that is, to draw upon the language of W alter 
Benjamin, a shift from law-  prese rving to law-  positi ng vio  lence (rechtserhal -
tende  to rechtsetzend Gewalt).67 In Anglo settler socie  ties, t he solution to 
this has often been to redeem the validity of founding through a recursive 
mechanism, one that sees the state acting “as if ” it is a source of publicly 
validated law  unt il such time that it properly becomes one (a point on the 
horizon that is, of course, ever receding). The state’s claim to a mono  poly 
over legitimate vio  lence exh ibits a performative quality: the assertion is an 
act that works to make real  ity co nform to the aspiration.
Consider the Intrusion Act of 1807, which expressly applied to squatters 
on already acquired public lands, that is, illegal possession within the ex -
tant ambit of U .S. law. However, since squatters, by definition, do not ob -
serve the bounds of law, the act acknowledged that they  wer e also found

 These  were squatters beyond the territorial bounds of the United States 
but nevertheless (and somewhat inexplicably) within the reach of the law. 
The act equivocates then between two dif  er ent p rob lems . One way to 
express this tension is through a distinction between illegality  and extrale -
gality. Whereas squatters on recognized and claimed U .S. public lands are 
clearly located within a sphere of illegality—  itself r eadily cognizable and 
justiciable by the law—  squa tters beyond the territorial bounds of the ex -
tant state are in a space of extralegality.  Their activities are “outside” U .S. 
law but not necessarily in conflict with it. The slippage between  these tw o 
is vexing from a  lega l standpoint (for instance, as a prob  lem of ju sticiability) 
yet especially productive and integral to the dispossessive pro  cess, since 
the prohibition against squatting in lands “not yet recognized” as within 
the bounds of the state presumptively figures  these lands a s awaiting in -
corporation, as potential but not yet fully actualized  public lands. In this 
way, the lands beyond the frontier are merely at a temporally  earlie r stage in 
the recursive pro  cess of le gitimation by which public lands came to be sub -
sumed beneath settler state law, since even the territory from which the law 
currently speaks (the settler metropole) is but a previous era’s quasi-  lega l 
frontier lands that have been retroactively validated. As such, we see judges 
and jurists of early nineteenth-  cen tury Amer  i ca st ruggling with the issue 
of frontier illegality not only as a prob  lem of en forcement but of law’s ulti -
mate legitimacy. As one Mississippi federal judge complained in a letter to 
President James Madison: “How can a jury be found in Monroe County to convict a man of intrusion
— where  every man is an intruder?”68
The solution to this was to incorporate a mea  sur e of illegality into the 
operation of the law, an illegality that, it was hoped, could be retroactively 
redeemed through a recursive device. In the early nineteenth  cen tury, this 
took the form of preemption. The word preemption refers to a preference 
or prior right of acquisition by a specific claimant, typically the occupant. 
In the early colonial period, it referred to a right claimed by one Eu  ro pean 
power against  others t o “first occupancy, ” assigning a special status to the 
original “discoverer” of a new territory. In the wake of U .S. in  de pen dence, 
the princi  ple was recognized by the Continental Congress and reformulated 
to apply to settlers on the western frontier. E fect ively, it gave squatters a 
right of first bid on territory they occupied, often at a significantly reduced price, provided they had dwelled on the land for a given period of time and had sufficiently “improved” it. In the period between staking an initial 
claim and redeeming that claim through purchase, squatters  wer e deemed

All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms 40 Chapte r One“tenants at  will.”69 If they sufficiently improved the land and raised enough 
capital eventually to buy it from  under t hemselves at auction, they  wer e 
efectively exonerated of the crime of trespass. If not, the state could remove 
them and sell the lands to more worthy competitors. In this way, a gray 
zone of illegality was preserved within the confines of the law itself in the form of delayed or belated enforcement: the distinction between an “illegal 
squatter” and “valid tenant at  will ” could only be known in light of the 
retrospective gaze.
Between 1799 and 1838, thirty-  thr ee special or temporary preemption 
acts  were passed.70 Originally contained as clauses within legislation whose 
primary intent was to restrict illegal squatting (e.g., within the Intrusion 
Act of 1807), such provisions  wer e expanded and formalized in their 
own right over the course of the 1820s, 1830s, and 1840s. In 1830 the first 
properly titled “Preemption Act, ” which included a general  pardo n for all 
inhabitants of illegally settled lands, was passed by Congress. Initially in -
tended to be a temporary mea  sur e, it set a new pre  ce dent. B y that point, 
settlers recognized that they could e fectively disregard the previous Intru -
sion Act since  ther e was a high degree of probability they would simply be 
exonerated by  lat er preemption legislation.71 In practice, then, the strange 
recursive relation between the Intrusion and Preemption Acts actually en -
couraged illegal settlement. By 1835 the preemption bill was coming up for renewal as frequently as annual appropriations.
72
In 1841, revisions to the policy of preemption sought to remove its awk -
ward retroactivity. From that point on, Congress did not even consider settlement prior to purchase as trespass per se, subject to some provisos. 
“Homesteaders” (as they  wer e now more positively deemed) had to be the 
head of a  family, a  widow , or a single man over twenty-  one years of ag e and 
a citizen of the United States (or current applicant for citizenship). They could not already be the proprietor of 320 acres or more of land in any state or territory, and must reside on the plot in question and “improve” it.
73 In 
this way, the Preemption Act not only gave legislative cover for squatting; it continued the Lockean ideal of restricting appropriation based on good standing, improvement, and sufficiency.
Squatters, homesteaders, and “tenants at  will ” thus came to possess a 
sui generis form of right—  the ret roactively legitimized, quasi-  lega l claim 
of preemption. As a hybrid racial-  lega l category of  peo ple, “Indians” pos -
sessed a corollary form of right that, not coincidently, was also referred to as “preemption.” In the 1820s and 1830s, American Indian law came to codify

All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms  tha t sole and despotic dominion  41“Indians” as  those who d id not possess full rights to sovereignty and land 
owner  ship.74 Theirs was a sui generis right of “occupancy” or “tenancy” 
and, in this sense, was not entirely dissimilar to squatter rights. The Indian 
form of preemption was, however, the inverted mirror reflection of that ac-corded to settler homesteaders. Whereas homesteaders possessed the pre -
emptive right to purchase , Indians held the preemptive right to sell. This 
truncated property right (i.e., the right to alienate) was, in e fect, one of the 
first “Indigenous rights.”
This does not mean that individuals once coded as “Indians” could 
never purchase land. It did require, however, that they could not legally own “homesteads.” For instance, legislation from 1865 provided for the first 
time the possibility for some Indians to receive homesteads  under t he 1862 
Homestead Act.75 An 1875 appropriations bill expanded and further en -
trenched this possibility but did so only through an explicit requirement that said Indians had “abandoned” their “tribal relations” (including pro -
viding “satisfactory proof of such abandonment”).
76 An 1884 revision to 
this further clarified that “Indian homesteads” would be held in trust by 
the federal government for twenty-  five years. The D awes Act came into ef -
fect in 1887 and, for the forty-  seve n years it was in e fect, it p rovided the 
legislative mechanism by which approximately 90 million additional acres 
of lands  were appropriated from Indigenous nations and distributed to 
“homesteaders”—an area larger than present-  day G ermany.77 In his exten -
sive documentation of this pro  cess, t he historian David Chang concludes, 
“ Allotment combined the making of land into private property and the taking of that private property from Indians.”
78 In a strict sense definitional, 
then, “Indians” alienated proprietary claims to land, whereas “homesteaders” actualized them. A single person could perform both roles but not at the same time: one was 
 either  an Indian or  a homesteader.
Attending to the movement of Intrusion→Preemption→Homesteading 
enables us to specify and concretize what it means to say that new property 
rights in land “left no room for the Indians” or  wer e “predicated upon their 
dispossession and dehumanisation.”79 Moreover, we can better grasp the re -
cursive logic of dispossession that made this pos  si ble. Fi rst, we can observe 
in it a kind of bootstrapping procedure that generates  lega l possession out 
of avowedly extralegal seizures. The admixture of legality and illegality in -
herent in this expressed itself in both spatial and temporal terms, as both a zone and a time, as the frontier  and the waiting period between initial tres-
pass and retrospective redemption through purchase.

All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms 42 Chapte r Onelights, extralegal seizure was the primary mechanism by which the United 
States expanded and consolidated its under  lying s ystem of proprietary title: 
theft quite literally produced property.
Second, this gives us a clear glimpse of the reconfigured relation be -
tween state and market. While the new republic attempted to deploy the 
traditional mechanisms of state control to contain the socioeconomic pro -
cesses unleashed in the de  cades fol lowing in  de pen dence, se nding military 
and police agents to restrict illegal squatters, this proved ultimately futile. 
Paradoxically, the state was both a central agent of market formation and in thrall to it. The land market that was created over the course of the nine -
teenth  century did not spring out of thin air as a model of self-  organ izing 
economic relations. Rather, it was a construct generated as much by the coercive power of the state apparatus as by “private” interests and individu -
als. The new market for land was,  after a ll, predicated on the military con -
quest of Indigenous  peo ples, their forced removal from the territories in 
question, and their de jure and de facto exclusion from the market through 
legislation explic  itly designe d to ensured Indians could not compete with 
white settlers when it came time to (re)purchase land at auction. At the same time, however, state officials quickly found they could not fully con -
tain or control market forces once they took hold. They could not fully con -
trol squatters, nor the proliferation of “Claims Clubs, ” which colluded to 
drive down land prices through collective bidding—  pract ices that gained 
increased respectability and  lega l protection through such organ  izatio ns as 
the National Land Association (founded in 1844 by George Henry Evans) 
and the  Free Soil Party (active from 1848 to 1852). What,  after a ll, was the 
United States itself if not a particularly large and well-  armed cl aims club? 
Thus, we find less a colonization pro  cess dr iven by state demands for terri -
torial sovereignty or  economic drives for capital accumulation than a com -
plex meeting of both. The two  wer e interwoven since, much as government 
officials might complain of meddlesome squatters, settlers  wer e the primary 
mechanism by which the state was able to convert frontier land from a threatening external wilderness to a fiscal resource and national asset.
81
Third and fi  nally, we have begun to identify the mechanism of transmis -
sion by which the dispossessive pro  cess b ecame a global phenomenon. 
Although initially wary of following the U .S. model, British colonial admin -
istrators in other regions of the world took note of the wealth and power it was capable of generating.
82 The new market in land, they recognized, was 
inherently (not contingently) expansionist and could not be controlled by 
agreements between gentlemen statesmen. One was  either forced to adapt

sessive pro  cess begun in the new U .S. republic pressed upon colonization 
pro cesses elsewhere, reshaping Anglo settler policy across the globe into an 
increasingly convergent form. As John W eaver puts it, “  ‘The exp ansionary 
drive of American culture’ was not just American.”83 It is beyond the scope 
of the pre  sent study to provide a full treatment of this complex field, but 
two brief illustrative examples from Canada and Aotearoa/New Zealand 
 will be useful.
The success of the U .S. model of territorial expansion placed immediate 
pressures on the Canadian colonies, which  wer e  under c onstant threat of 
being overtaken by the republic to the south from the time of the revolu -
tion through much of the nineteenth  cen tury. Not only was the United 
States more populous and more power  ful ; it was also a more attractive des -
tination for many Eu  ro pean mi  gran ts precisely due to the high availability 
of land. Additionally, the Canadian example is often held up in contrast to 
that of the United States, in part  bec ause, in the majority of the country at 
least, the territorial acquisition pro  cess o perated through a series of trea -
ties signed between Anglo colonial officials and Indigenous leaders.84  These 
came in two waves. From 1871 to 1877, T reaties 1 through 7 secured the 
southern half of the western “prairie” provinces. Then, from 1899 to 1921, T reaties 8 through 11 incorporated a vast expanse of land in the northern 
half of  those provinces, plus portions of what is now British Columbia, 
Ontario, the Northwest, and Y ukon territories. Since  these  wer e highly 
formal, ceremonial a fairs between the official representatives of the Crown 
and  those of the respective Indigenous nations, they seem to have more to 
do with agreements between nations than transactions between subjects, 
more about sovereignty than property. In one re  spe ct, this is true.  These 
agreements  wer e understood to operate on this nation-  to- nat ion basis, and 
in many cases still are. Considered from the standpoint of high constitu -
tional theory, the treaty system governing Indigenous-  Canad ian relations 
has been regarded as a model of cooperation and consent.85 Viewed from 
the vantage of po  liti cal e conomy, however, the Canadian and U .S. models 
converge in impor  tant w ays.
Colonial administrators in “British North Amer  i ca” h ave long under -
stood that the agreements between sovereigns would be practically mean -
ingless if they  wer e not able to move large numbers of settlers into disputed 
regions so as to practically displace Indigenous  peo ples’ presence and

sovereigns; they needed property. Property served as both a  lega l mecha -
nism to anchor Crown title materially and an economic incentive to mo -
tivate (re)settlement. Thus, although “the Canadas” retained a distinctive 
 legal and po  liti cal s ystem, it was not long before administrators  ther e reali -
zed that grafting this onto an American-  style s ystem of landed property 
owner  ship would be vital to maintaining and expanding British North 
Amer  i ca.86
This largely took the form of transitioning from a feudal and seigneurial 
“land grant” system to a market system of direct purchase and sale. An early 
moment in this transition arose in the late 1830s. In 1838 the Whig poli -
tician and eventually governor general and high commissioner of British 
North Amer  i ca, J ohn Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham, was sent to the Ca -
nadian colonies to investigate the 1837–38 rebellions  ther e. Accompanied 
by Edward Gibbon W akefield and Charles Buller, the trio eventually com -
posed a Report on the Affairs of British North Amer  i ca, commonly known 
as Lord Durham’s Report.  Much of the report contained recommendations 
for changing the governance structure of the Canadas, and it is generally credited with ushering in “responsible government” through the devolution 
of powers to local, elected legislatures. What concerns us  here, ho wever, 
are the sections of the Report dealing with land tenure. On this front, Lord 
Durham observed:
The system of the United States appears to combine all the chief requi -
sites of the greatest efficiency. It is uniform throughout the vast federa -
tion; it is unchangeable save by Congress, and has never been materially altered; it renders the acquisition of new land easy, and yet, by means 
of price, restricts appropriation to the  actua l wants of the settler; it is so 
 simple as to be readily understood; it provides for accurate surveys and 
against  needless delays; it gives an instant and secure title; and it admits 
of no favouritism, but distributes the public land amongst all classes and persons upon precisely equal terms. That system has promoted an amount of immigration and settlement of which the history of the 
world a fords no other example.87
Accordingly, the report recommended transitioning the Canadian land ap -
propriation and distribution system to mimic that of the United States. Since the landed gentry had a greater hold on the Canadas than was the 
case in the more republican-  orie nted nation to the south, this took some 
time. However, over the next de  cades, t he public lands system was radi -

this in the Dominion Lands Act, which was extensively copied from the U .S. Homestead Act of 1862.
88 From that point on, the Canadian landed 
property system began to substantially converge with that of the United States.
One major irony of this transition was that, although the model for a 
homesteading market in land came from the United States, colonial admin-
istrators in British North Amer  i ca ( lat er Canada)  wer e wary of adopting it 
for fear of being overtaken by waves of American citizens moving north. 
In other words, they recognized that de jure changes to the  lega l system of 
land acquisition and distribution could potentially lead to their de facto an -
nexation by the United States.89 British colonial administrators knew this 
well  because it was precisely what they  wer e attempting to do vis-  à- vis In -
digenous  peoples. Just as had occurred south of the (newly formed) border, 
landed property incentivized the mass movement of Euro-  Amer ican set -
tlers and, also like the U .S. case, the demographic shift had a corresponding 
efect on  legal interpretation. As the “treaty rights” of Indigenous  peo ples 
increasingly came into conflict with the public and private law of Anglo 
settlers, they  wer e incrementally hollowed out and subordinated to settler 
interests.90 In short, dispossession did not proceed through macro asser -
tions of sovereignty but through microlevel practices that worked to dis -
mantle one infrastructure of life and replace it with another.91 Beneath and 
beyond the lofty agreements encoded in the treaties, Canadian administra -
tors worked to destroy the economic foundation of Indigenous socie  ties, 
using starvation to drive them into submission.92 It was also at precisely this 
time that legislation codified the legal-  racial c ategory of “Indian, ” which 
included property restrictions for  those un willing to adopt Eu  ro pean wa ys 
or unfit for full enfranchisement.93 T ogether,  these mea  sur es produced 
several waves of re  sis tance, i ncluding the Red River Rebellion in 1869–70 
and Northwest Rebellion in 1885 by Métis, Cree, and Assiniboine  peo ples. 
 These re  sis tance movements  wer e defeated by Canadian military and po -
lice forces and—  aga in following the U .S. model established in the Dakota 
W ars—  led to the largest public mass execution in Canadian history: the 
Battleford hangings.94
This hybrid public/private form of dispossession was given full judi -
cial backing in the Canadas in St. Catharines Milling and Lumber Co. v. R 
(1888). In that case, the majority (explic  itly citi ng V attel, Montesquieu, and 
Adam Smith) held that Indian title should be understood as “mere occu -
pancy for the purposes of hunting.” It could not be taken in the sense of full

All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms 46 Chapte r Onetenure, for the Indigenous  peo ples “have no idea of a title to the soil itself. It 
is over-  run by them rather than inhabited.” In a succinct articulation of the 
“negative” logic of Indigenous proprietary interests, the court concluded 
that aboriginal title was “a right not to be transferred but extinguished.”95 
The court clearly ascribed to “Indians” a certain right that could only be actualized through alienation. Even the dissenting opinion did not dispute 
the under  lying negative nature of aboriginal title. Justice J. A. Patterson ob -
jected to the majority, writing that Indigenous  peo ples should be “admitted 
to be the rightful occupants of the soil, with a  lega l as well as a just claim 
to retain possession of it, and to use it according to their own discretion.” He even contended that this constituted a form of sovereignty “in a certain sense.” When pressed to elaborate upon this “certain sense, ” Patterson clari -
fied, however, that he meant only that Indigenous  peo ples “might sell or 
transfer [the land] to the sovereign who discovered it.” They  wer e still right -
fully “denied authority to dispose of it to any other persons, and,  unt il such 
a sale or transfer, they  wer e generally permitted to occupy it as sovereigns de 
facto.”96 This decision remained the princi  ple  lega l decision on aboriginal 
title in Canada  unt il the 1970s.
The convergence of U .S. and British modes of dispossession was not re -
stricted to North Amer  i ca. R ather, as John W eaver points out, as the colo -
nies turned from land grants to land sales, distinctions between British and American settler colonies eventually “consisted principally of instrumental details; no longer did they express a fundamental divergence in convictions about land, social order, and power.”
97
The case of Aotearoa/New Zealand illustrates this point all the more.98 
Although Eu  ro pe ans had h ad knowledge of the Aotearoa islands since the 
seventeenth  cen tury, concerted e for ts at colonization did not begin  unt il 
the early nineteenth  cen tury. British colonists  wer e initially impressed with 
Māori levels of sociocultural development, often contrasting them favor -
ably with the Australian Aborigines, whom they held in lower regard. Of 
par tic u lar importance was the widespread practice of settled agriculture 
among the Māori, which the British took as a sign of civilizational devel -
opment. Consequently, British colonial administrators generally accepted that the Māori held proprietary rights to the land and that Aotearoa was not, in any meaningful sense, vacant or unclaimed land. As Ernst Dief -
fenback reported in 1843: “  Eve ry inch of land in New Zealand has its 
proprietor.”99 The result of this recognition was that the British colo -

through purchase—  acquisit ion by agreement, not by “occupation alone.”
Within this general framework, two serious obstacles remained. First, 
as historian Stuart Banner explains, although the British generally recog -
nized that the Māori had some  preexisting system of property, the radical 
diference of that system continued to elude and frustrate them. The Māori 
did not tend to allocate property rights to land through a geospatial 
“grid” system, as was common in the Anglophone world. A par  tic u lar 
Māori person could not “own” a discrete and distinct zone of space, over 
which they could exercise exclusive control. Instead, property rights  wer e 
traditionally allocated on a functional basis. Individuals—or, as was more 
common, families—  could cl aim a proprietary interest to a certain kind of 
activity within a circumscribed context, for example, a right to fish from 
this stream, or collect fruit from that  tree, at this time of year, and so on. 
Since proprietary interests  wer e functional in this way, they overlapped and 
coexisted in the same geographic space. Moreover, since they  wer e typi -
cally apportioned based on familial lineages, recitation of genealogy was 
more impor  tant to the reconstruction of one’s property rights than British 
geospatial techniques of enclosure, fencing, and mapping. British colonists of the period frequently expressed frustration at their inability to grasp the 
myriad interlay of proprietary claims within a single space and, in par  tic u-
lar, the difficulty in bundling them together so as to acquire total control over all objects and activities within a single zone of space (as was their own custom). As  E.  G. W akefield complained to a committee of the House of Commons: “The right of individual property has never existed in New Zealand.”

rial claims. Although many British colonial administrators  wer e willing to 
concede that the Māori possessed proprietary interests in the land, which could not be unilaterally revoked without some cause, they disagreed over 
 whether  those interests extended to all of New Zealand or only to  those 
parts that the Māori  wer e physically occupying and “improving” at the time 
of contact with the Crown. Even the 1840 T reaty of W aitangi, meant to 
clarify such  mat ters, left considerable ambiguity on this point. For while it 
did confirm that the Māori  wer e to enjoy “full exclusive and undisturbed 
possession” of their lands, it did not specify which  lands fell  under that des -
ignation. By the late 1840s, the general consensus among British colonial elites was that the Māori could only lay claim to truly “possess” lands they had enclosed and cultivated in good Lockean fashion. As Earl Grey, the

mate claims “to that portion of the soil, which they  real ly occupied, ” that 
is, where they “practised to a certain extent a rude sort of agriculture.” This, 
he was clear, was very  lim ited: “The savage inhabitants of New Zealand had 
themselves no right of property in land which they did not occupy.”101 In 
the end, then, the colonial government did recognize some Māori rights to 
land but only by a narrow, British standard.102
 After the 1840s, the strategy switched to affirming Māori rights to land 
so as to secure the mechanism of transfer by direct purchase. By 1865 this included direct purchase from individuals; it no longer required the col -
lective assent of the tribe (despite the fact that, by then, the British had 
grasped that Māori property rights  wer e not individuated in such a way 
that a par  tic u lar ind ividual could sell o f a ge ographic space by him-   or her -
self ). A confusing mess of purchases resulted, which generated nearly end -
less appeals. Of the 9.3 million acres of land originally submitted to review 
by dispute tribunals, 8.8 million acres  wer e deemed to have been transferred 
improperly.103
In response to this confusion, the Crown began to assert its right of pre -
emption more aggressively. It e fectively imposed a mono  poly ov er sales, 
prohibiting settlers from engaging in private purchases directly from the Māori. This reaped enormous financial benefits for the Crown, which made 
huge profits by serving as the go-  betw een in settler-Maori land sales of 
the 1840s and 1850s. This also meant, however, that settlers  wer e  eage r to 
circumvent the system and buy more cheaply directly from Māori without colonial intervention (and without taxation on sales). At the same time, 
the Crown worked hard to prevent the Māori from forming a single organ  i-
zation that could control and regulate sales from their end. British colonial 
officials  were highly  adept at p laying one tribe against another, a policy that 
often included the selling of weapons to  enem y groups.
The Māori recognized that the British mono  poly ov er the point of sale 
was to their  grea t disadvantage and that, if they could coordinate a similar 
mono  poly, they might be able to slow the land appropriation pro  cess and 
exercise more e fective control over it. T o this end, dif  er ent M āori tribal 
groups began to converge and coordinate such that, by the late 1850s, they 
 were able to orchestrate an e fective moratorium on land sales in the North 
Island. In direct response to this, the British changed tactics in two impor -
tant ways. First, they altered the market for land.  Afte r 1865, colonial au -
thorities began to impose high tari fs on land t ransactions. Māori sellers 
 were expected to pay  these ind irect costs, which severely undercut their

All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms  tha t sole and despotic dominion  49profits and bargaining position. By contrast, the government artificially 
subsidized the pro  cess o n the buyers’ end, e fect ively preventing the Māori 
from passing on new costs to settlers. The second tactic was borrowed 
from a very old imperial playbook. British colonial officials sold muskets 
to favored Māori tribes, while imposing a moratorium on sales to  those 
who resisted the new market mea  sur es. The resulting military asymmetries 
generated intense intra-  Māor i rivalry and, eventually, war. T o some degree 
this was a continuation of an older strategy. Between 1807 and 1845, an 
estimated three thousand  bat tles had already been fought between vari  ous 
Māori groups in the so-  cal led Musket W ars. This intensified again in the 
1860s, however, when the British focused on breaking up e forts by Māori 
leaders to halt land sales through the “King movement.” When full-  scale 
war fi  nally broke out, one Māori commentator, T eni te Kopara, summed up 
“the cause and the evil” in one word: “land.”104
The overall e fect of this twin strategy was devastating for the Māori, 
who lost control over the vast majority of territory, with  litt le monetary 
benefit to show for it.105 British colonial officials could boast on two fronts. 
They had acquired almost the entirety of New Zealand and had done so not through force and conquest but through contract and purchase. If the 
Māori  were resentful or regretful, this was interpreted as a symptom of 
their own failure to transition to modern economic realities. As Attorney General Robert Stout explained, Māori dispossession was due to the fact 
that “the Natives cannot equal the Eu  ro pe ans in bu ying, or selling, or in 
other  things. They have not gone through that long pro  cess of e volution 
which the white race has gone through.”106
In less than one hundred years, British colonizers had managed si  mul  ta-
neously to convert the under  lying p roperty regime of Aotearoa and trans -
fer owner  ship of it. As Banner argues, if they  wer e able to do so, it was 
a function of two attributes the British possessed that the Māori lacked. 
First, the British  wer e able to e fect ively or  ga nize the mselves as a single 
actor within the emerging land market, whereas the Māori  wer e splintered 
into several smaller units. This generated a structural asymmetry in the bar -
gaining relationship, such that transfer was, in the long run, unidirectional. This would appear to be an attribute of the market system itself. However, 
it was ultimately generated by a second, extra-  eco nomic attribute. As Ban -
ner points out: “The market looked the way it did  bec ause the British  wer e 
power  ful enough to design it and to rebu f Mao ri efor ts to impose a dif -
fer ent structure. That power rested on the military and technological su -
periority that allowed the Eu  ro pean st ates to colonize much of the world

property rights they would enforce and how they would be enforced.”107 
As a result, although the dispossession pro  cess i n New Zealand operated 
primary through a market mechanism, it was no less a function of coercive 
force than the more openly-  declar ed wars and thefts that characterized the 
Australian or U .S. cases. In e fect, the British constructed a set of  lega l, po -
liti cal, and economic institutions in which the Māori literally could not 
refuse to alienate their rights. Consent was legible only as assent to this 
system of self-  exti nguishment.
The above analy  sis prov ides specific, concrete examples of how the emer -
gence of a system of landed property in the United States, Canada, and 
New Zealand came to serve as a tool of dispossession in  those loc ales.  These 
examples are, however, neither exhaustive in detail nor comprehensive in scope. Much more could be said about each case, and the cases could be expanded to include (at least) Australia or South Africa. What I have provided is, however, sufficient for the immediate aims of my argument. 
For we have established two impor  tant cl aims. First, one can now readily 
observe that, despite the internally complex and heterodox field of Anglo 
settler  legal and po  liti cal t hought, a relatively uniform e fect is ne vertheless 
observable with regard to the impact  these pr o cesses h ad on Indigenous 
 peoples. While the United States, Canada, and New Zealand have very 
dif er ent formal modes of authorizing and anchoring their  lega l claims to 
territory, the  actua l situation on the ground as experienced by Indigenous 
 peoples in  these dif  er ent lo cales reveals considerable overlap. This  mat ters 
 because it o fers an impor  tant r ejoinder to the concern that anticolonial 
critique imposes a false uniformity and coherence upon W estern  lega l and 
po liti cal thought, and “in so  doin g slips into precisely the kind of rational -
ist universalism that it decries.”108 In this case, the prob  lem la ys not in the 
uniformity of de jure assertions but in the convergent de facto materializa -
tions. This cannot be understood without taking into account the political-  
economic pro  cesses t hat actualize settler colonial  lega l and po  liti cal cl aims, 
nor without re  orie nting the vantage point one brings to bear upon the 
 whole and including Indigenous perspectives (points that are unpacked in 
greater detail in chapter 3).
Moreover, we are in a better position now to see why  ther e are, in fact, 
two contexts and two conceptual lineages  behi nd the language of dispos -
session: one Eu  ro pean and one A nglo-  colo nial. In the first, dispossession

from feudalism to capitalism. In the latter, it functions to analyze how the 
expansion of Anglo-  Eur opean systems of land owner  ship w orked as a tool 
of “legalized theft” in the apprehension of Indigenous territory. Through a 
variety of  these methods and techniques, over the course of the nineteenth 
 century alone, Anglo settler  peo ples managed to acquire an estimated 9.89 
million square miles of land, that is, approximately 6   per cent of the total 
land on the surface of Earth in about one hundred years: the single largest 
and most significant land grab in  hum an history.109 An additional compli -
cation remains, however.  These are not parallel stories that run in isolation 
from one another but rather intertwined and practically co-  con stituting. 
What remains then is to think them in tandem, which is the aim of the next chapter.
